The given smart contract seems to have the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The contract sends ether with `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` before it reduces the sender's balance `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`. An attacker can recursively call the `CashOut` function in the fallback function to drain the contract.

2. Access Control: There seems to be no access control mechanism in the contract. This means that any address can call any function in the contract. For example, any address can set the `TransferLog` which logs transactions.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses `call.value()` without checking the return value. This is dangerous because the call might fail silently.

4. Time Manipulation: The contract uses `block.number` and `now` for timing. Both of these can be manipulated by miners to some extent.

5. Denial of Service: If the address that the contract calls in `CashOut` function throws an exception, the `CashOut` function will be stuck because of the `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` condition.

The contract does not seem to have vulnerabilities related to Arithmetic Issues, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, and Short Address Attack. However, a comprehensive audit by a professional security auditor is highly recommended to ensure its security.
