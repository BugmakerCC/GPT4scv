This smart contract appears to have a few potential vulnerabilities:

1) Reentrancy: Reentrancy attacks are not directly visible in this contract. However, it is recommended to use a mutex or checks-effects-interactions pattern to avoid potential reentrancy attacks.

2) Access Control: The contract utilizes the `owner` and `migrationMaster` variables for access control. It's important to ensure that these are securely managed, as there are numerous functions that rely on the sender being the `owner` or `migrationMaster`.

3) Arithmetic Issues: The contract uses a SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, which should prevent overflows and underflows.

4) Unchecked Return Values: This contract does not check the return values of the `send` or `transfer` functions, which could lead to unexpected behavior if these calls fail.

5) Denial of Service: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

6) Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness, so this is not a concern.

7) Front-Running: As with any contract that involves value transactions, front-running could potentially be an issue.

8) Time manipulation: The contract uses `block.number` for timing, which can be manipulated by miners to a certain degree. 

9) Short Address Attack: The contract does not check the length of the input addresses, making it potentially vulnerable to a short address attack. 

Remember, this is not a thorough security audit and it's always recommended to get a full audit by a professional before deploying any smart contract.
