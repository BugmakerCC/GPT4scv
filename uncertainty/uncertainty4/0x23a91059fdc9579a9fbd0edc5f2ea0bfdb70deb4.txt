The provided smart contract has at least two vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `CashOut(uint _am)` is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. It is using a call.value()() function to send Ether, which allows the receiving contract to execute code. If the receiving contract is malicious, it could call `CashOut()` again before `balances[msg.sender] -= _am;` is executed. This could result in the attacker withdrawing more Ether than they should be able to. The solution is to use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern: first check conditions, then update state variables, and finally interact with other contracts.

2. Denial of Service: If an attacker sets a contract as the receiver of the funds, and that contract has a fallback function which always throws, it would make the `CashOut()` function get stuck as the Ether transfer would never be successful. This could potentially block all users from withdrawing their funds. To prevent this, a better practice is to use the `transfer()` function instead of `call.value()()`, which has a gas limit of 2300 and does not allow the receiver to execute more than a few simple instructions.

Moreover, the contract does not have explicit access control mechanisms which could be a security risk. As it stands, anyone can potentially call any function in the contract. If it's intended that only certain addresses can call certain functions, then appropriate access control mechanisms should be implemented.
