The smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability exists in the `Collect` function. The contract performs a state change after an external call to `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. An attacker can potentially call back into `Collect` before `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` is executed.

   To fix this issue, the state should be updated before the external call. This can be done by moving `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` before `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`.

2. Access Control: There is no access control for the functions `SetMinSum`, `SetLogFile`, and `Initialized`. Anyone can call these functions and change the state of the contract. 

   To fix this issue, only the contract owner should be able to call these functions. This can be done by adding a `onlyOwner` modifier to these functions.

3. Unchecked Return Value: The contract does not check the return value of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. If this call fails, the contract will not be aware.

   To fix this issue, the return value of the call should be checked and handled accordingly.

4. Denial of Service: If an attacker sets the `MinSum` to a high value, it could lead to a denial of service for other users who are trying to collect their balances.

5. Timestamp Dependence: The `LogFile` contract uses `now` for timestamping. This can be manipulated by miners to some extent.

The contract doesn't seem to have issues related to Arithmetic, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, and Short Address Attack.
