The smart contract provided exhibits the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The smart contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attack due to the use of `.call.value()` in the `sendMoney` function. This function is not protected by a mutex, hence it allows for recursive calls back into the contract before the function is completed, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or loss of funds.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `.call.value()` function used in the `sendMoney` function doesn't check the return value. This can lead to silent failures if the call fails, as the return value is not checked.

3. Access Control: While the contract uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access to certain functions to only the contract owner, it doesn't provide a way to change the owner address. If the owner's private key is lost or compromised, it could lead to permanent loss of control over the contract.

To fix these vulnerabilities:

1. Use a mutex or the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy.

2. Always check the return value of `.call.value()` and handle potential failures appropriately.

3. Implement a function to change the owner of the contract, ensuring that the function can only be called by the current owner.
