The smart contract provided has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks in the `withdraw()`, `request()`, `deliver()`, and `cancel()` functions. These functions send ether with a call.value()() pattern which allows external contract to be called before the state of the current contract is settled. This can lead to an attack where external contract calls the function again before its state is settled. To avoid this vulnerability, the state should be settled before calling an external contract.

2. Access control: The contract has a weak access control in the `upgrade()`, `reset()`, `suspend()`, `restart()`, and `withdraw()` functions. These functions can only be called by the requester of the first request. This can lead to unwanted behavior if the address of the first requester is compromised.

3. Arithmetic Issues: This contract doesn't seem to have any integer overflow or underflow issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values: The contract doesn't check the return value of the `send()` method in `deliver()` function, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

5. Denial of Service: The contract is vulnerable to DOS attacks. If an attacker manages to make the `externalCallFlag` true, then all calls to `request()`, `deliver()`, and `cancel()` will throw an exception leading to a DOS.

6. Bad Randomness: This contract doesn't seem to use randomness so this vulnerability does not apply.

7. Front Running: This contract doesn't seem to have front-running issues.

8. Time manipulation: The contract doesn't depend on timestamps or block numbers for critical logic, so this vulnerability does not apply.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract doesn't seem to have short address attacks issues.

NOTE: Just because some vulnerabilities do not seem to apply, does not mean the contract is secure. This analysis is based on the code provided and there may be other vulnerabilities not listed here.
