The smart contract code provided here may have the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This occurs in `multiplicate(address adr)` function where it's transferring ethers to an external address. If the external address is a contract, it could call back into `multiplicate()` before the first invocation is finished, potentially draining the contract of its funds.

2. Access Control: Anybody can call the `multiplicate(address adr)` function. If the condition `msg.value>=this.balance` is met, they can drain all the funds in the contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: In the `multiplicate(address adr)` function, the balance is added to the msg.value without any checks for overflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);` in the `Command(address adr,bytes data)` is a low level call and its return value is not checked. If this call fails, the contract won't be aware of it.

5. Denial of Service: If the owner's address becomes a contract that throws an exception, then the `withdraw()` function may always fail, blocking the withdrawal of ethers forever.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable here as no randomness is involved in this contract.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable here as no transaction ordering dependence is observed.

8. Time manipulation: Not applicable here as no timestamp dependence is observed.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable here as the contract does not take any address as an argument from external calls. All addresses are provided by the contract owner.

Please note that the solidity version used here (0.4.18) is also outdated and may have additional vulnerabilities. It is always recommended to use the latest version of solidity.
