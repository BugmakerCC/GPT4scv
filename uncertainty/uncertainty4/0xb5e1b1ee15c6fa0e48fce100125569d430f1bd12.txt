1. Reentrancy: The 'CashOut' function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it makes an external call to the sender before it updates the state (balances[msg.sender] -= _am). An attacker could create a fallback function in their contract to repeatedly call the 'CashOut' function before the state has been updated, effectively draining the contract of Ether.

2. Access Control: There doesn't seem to be any access control issues in this contract, as there are no functions or variables that should be restricted to certain addresses.

3. Arithmetic Issues: This contract is not vulnerable to integer overflow or underflow because it does not perform any arithmetic operations that are capable of producing these issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The 'CashOut' function uses a low-level call (msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) without checking its return value. If the call fails for any reason, the contract will not be notified and continue execution.

5. Denial of Service: The contract uses a loop in the 'AddMessage' function, which could potentially be exploited to cause a denial of service attack by making the gas cost of transactions extremely high.

6. Bad Randomness: There doesn't seem to be any randomness in this contract, so it's not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: There are no transaction ordering dependencies in this contract, so it's not vulnerable to front-running.

8. Time manipulation: The 'AddMessage' function uses the 'now' keyword (alias for block.timestamp), making it vulnerable to minor time manipulation by miners.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract does not seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack because it does not take address arguments from external callers and does not perform raw token transfers.

Please note that this is a basic analysis and a more thorough audit might reveal other subtle bugs or vulnerabilities.
