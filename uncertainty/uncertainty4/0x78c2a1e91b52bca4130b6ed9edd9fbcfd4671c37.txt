The smart contract provided has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This contract has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `redeem` function. The contract transfers ether (`Owner.transfer` and `msg.sender.transfer`) after the `if(msg.value>=minEligibility)` check, which can allow for a recursive call where a malicious contract drains the contract’s ether.

2. Access Control: The contract has an access control vulnerability in the `withdraw` and `Command` functions. The contract checks if `msg.sender` is equal to `Owner`. However, the owner can be changed by any address that matches the hard-coded address in the `withdraw` function. This lack of strict access control allows for potential unauthorised contract control.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not seem to have any arithmetic issues such as integer overflow and underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses a low-level `.call` in the `Command` function without checking its return value. This can potentially result in a silent failure.

5. Denial of Service: The contract seems to be free from any obvious denial of service vulnerabilities.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use randomness, so this vulnerability does not apply.

7. Front-Running: This contract could be susceptible to front-running in the `redeem` function. A malicious miner could see a transaction calling this function and insert their own transaction with a higher gas price, thus being included in the blockchain first and draining the contract’s ether.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not depend on timestamps or block numbers for its operation, so it's not vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract does not seem to have any code that could be susceptible to a short address attack.

Please note that this analysis only covers the common vulnerabilities listed and may not include all potential vulnerabilities. A more thorough audit could uncover additional issues.
