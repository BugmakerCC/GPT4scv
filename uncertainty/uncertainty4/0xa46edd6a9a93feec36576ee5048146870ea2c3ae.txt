The smart contract provided has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: There is a potential for a Reentrancy attack. The `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v[i]);` may call an external contract that could call back into the `transfer` function before the first invocation of the `transfer` function has completed.

2. Access Control: There is no access control in the `transfer` function. Anybody can call this function with any parameters.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The return value of `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v[i]);` is not checked. If this call fails, the contract will not be aware of it.

4. Denial of Service: If a large number of addresses are passed to the `transfer` function, it could run out of gas, effectively blocking further execution.

5. Front-Running: Since the function does not have any access control, it is possible for an attacker to front-run a transaction.

6. Short Address Attack: Since the contract does not check the length of the address parameters, it may be vulnerable to a short address attack if the calling function does not properly validate the length of input addresses.

The contract does not seem to have vulnerabilities related to Arithmetic Issues, Bad Randomness, and Time manipulation. However, without the full context of how this contract is used, it is impossible to say for certain.
