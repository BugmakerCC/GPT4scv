The smart contract provided has a common vulnerability known as Reentrancy.

In the `CashOut` function, the contract sends Ether to an address before it reduces the balance of that address:

```
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
{
    balances[msg.sender]-=_am;
    TransferLog.AddMessage(msg.sender,_am,"CashOut");
}
```

Here, the contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. An attacker can create a fallback function in their contract to call the `CashOut` function again before the first call can finish. This would allow the attacker to drain more Ether than they should be able to according to their balance. 

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balances before making the call:

```
if(_am<=balances[msg.sender])
{
    balances[msg.sender]-=_am;
    if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
    {
        TransferLog.AddMessage(msg.sender,_am,"CashOut");
    }
    else
    {
        balances[msg.sender]+=_am;
    }
}
```

The above code will ensure that the `balances` mapping is updated before the external call is made.

As for other vulnerabilities:

- Access Control: The contract does not have any function or modifier to restrict access to certain functions.
- Arithmetic Issues: There doesn't seem to be any overflows or underflows possible.
- Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The return value of the low-level call in `CashOut` function is checked.
- Denial of Service: There seems to be no potential for DoS attack in the contract.
- Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness.
- Front-Running: The contract does not seem to have any front-running vulnerabilities.
- Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps or block numbers.
- Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack.
