Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, I've identified the below vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The 'withdrawEther' function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it calls an external contract (via the 'transfer' function) after the contract's state has been changed. To fix this, the 'transfer' function call should be the last operation in the function.

2. Access Control: There are no access control checks in the 'withdrawTokens' and 'withdrawEther' functions. This means anyone (not just the contract owner) can call these functions and potentially withdraw tokens or Ether. To fix this, a 'require' statement should be added to these functions to ensure only the contract owner can call them.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The 'call' function in 'getTokens' function returns a boolean value indicating success or failure, but this return value is not checked. To fix this, a 'require' statement should be added after the 'call' function to ensure it succeeded.

4. Denial of Service: The 'getTokens' function could potentially run out of gas if 'num' is very large, causing a Denial of Service. To fix this, a limit should be set on 'num'.

5. Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time Manipulation, Short Address Attack: These vulnerabilities are not present in the provided smart contract.
