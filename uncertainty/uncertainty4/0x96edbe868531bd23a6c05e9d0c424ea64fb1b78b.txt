This contract appears to have several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `Collect` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. It calls an external contract (with `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`) before it updates the state (`acc.balance-=_am;`). An attacker can create a fallback function in their contract that calls `Collect` again before the original `Collect` call has finished, thereby draining more Ether than they are supposed to be able to.

2. Access Control: The functions `SetMinSum`, `SetLogFile` and `Initialized` can be called by anyone since they don't have any access control conditions. This allows anyone to set the minimum sum and log file, and initialize the contract.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is a low level call that can fail silently. The return value is not checked, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

4. Denial of Service: If an attacker purposely fails the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` function, it can block users from calling the `Collect` function, causing a denial of service.

5. Time manipulation: The `Put` function relies on `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) for setting the `unlockTime`. Miners have some control over this value, which can be manipulated.

For the rest of the vulnerabilities, there isn't enough information in the provided contract to determine if the contract is vulnerable. For example, we can't say if there are arithmetic issues without seeing the context in which numerical operations are performed. Similarly, we can't say if there is bad randomness without seeing if the contract relies on unpredictable values. The contract does not appear to be vulnerable to front-running or short address attacks.
