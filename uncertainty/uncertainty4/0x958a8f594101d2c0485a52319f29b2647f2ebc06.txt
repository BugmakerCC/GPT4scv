The given smart contract has at least two types of vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This contract uses a low-level call in the `execute` function of the `Owned` contract. This function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks as it does not have any mutex or reentrancy guard. This could potentially allow malicious contracts to repeatedly enter the function and drain ether before the state (e.g., balance) is updated.

```solidity
function execute(address _dst, uint _value, bytes _data) onlyOwner {
    _dst.call.value(_value)(_data);
}
```
Mitigation: Make sure to update state variables before making external calls. Consider using the “Checks-Effects-Interactions” pattern, and/or reentrancy guards.

2. Access Control: The `acceptOwnership` function in the `Owned` contract allows any contract or account to accept the ownership if they can call `acceptOwnership`. This could lead to potential takeover of the contract by an unauthorized address if the `newOwner` address is coerced or tricked into making the call.

```solidity
function acceptOwnership() {
    if (msg.sender == newOwner) {
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}
```
Mitigation: Consider requiring the current `owner` to confirm the change of ownership, or implement a more robust and secure ownership transfer mechanism. 

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `execute` function in the `Owned` contract does not check the return value of the low-level call, which could lead to silent failures.

Mitigation: Always check the return value of a low-level call and handle failure cases appropriately.

4. Denial of Service: In `sendMessage` function, if the contract's balance is high and the `owner` account is a contract with a fallback function that consumes more than 2300 gas, the `transfer` will fail and no more messages can be sent.

Mitigation: Implement pull payment system instead of direct transfer to avoid being stuck due to gas limit.

Please note that the above review does not guarantee the security of the contract and further in-depth analysis including but not limited to race conditions, front-running, time manipulation, and arithmetic issues is needed.
