The contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `Collect` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it uses a low-level `.call.value` method without taking measures to prevent reentrancy. The `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` should be placed before the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` to prevent the attack.

2. Access Control: The contract does not implement any form of access control. Anyone can call the `SetMinSum`, `SetLogFile`, and `Initialized` functions. This could be mitigated by implementing a modifier that only allows a specific address (like the contract owner) to call these functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: If an attacker can cause an overflow or underflow of the balances mapping, they could potentially steal Ether. This can be mitigated by using SafeMath library for arithmetic operations.

4. Unchecked Return Values: The `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `Collect` function does not check the return value. If the call fails for any reason, the contract's state would be incorrect.

5. Denial of Service: If an attacker is able to force the `Collect` function to always fail (for example by causing the `call.value` to always fail by having a fallback function that always throws), they could lock up all of the funds in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable in this contract.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable in this contract.

8. Time Manipulation: Not applicable in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable in this contract.
