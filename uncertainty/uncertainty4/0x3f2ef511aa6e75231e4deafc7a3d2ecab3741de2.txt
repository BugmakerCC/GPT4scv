Upon analyzing the provided smart contract, I found the following potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `redeem()` is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. It makes an external call to `msg.sender.transfer()`, during which state changes have not occurred and can be interrupted.

2. Access Control: The functions `withdraw()` and `Command()` are only protected by a simple check to `msg.sender == Owner`. If the `Owner` address gets compromised, the contract's balance can be drained.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There doesn't seem to be any arithmetic operations performed in this contract, thus it's not vulnerable to integer overflows or underflows.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The function `Command()` uses a low level `.call()` function without checking its return value, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

6. Bad Randomness: There is no randomness involved in this contract, so it's not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: There is no transaction ordering dependence, so the contract is not vulnerable to front-running.

8. Time manipulation: There is no dependence on timestamps, so the contract is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not take any address as input from the user, so it's not vulnerable to short address attack.

Please note that this analysis is not exhaustive and the contract could have other vulnerabilities not covered by the above list.
