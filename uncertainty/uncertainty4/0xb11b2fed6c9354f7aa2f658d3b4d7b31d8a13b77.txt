The smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdraw` function in `DepositProxy` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack since it first sends funds with `msg.sender.transfer(amount);` and then updates the state with `Deposits[msg.sender] -= amount;`. An attacker can recursively call the `withdraw` function to drain the contract's funds.

2. Access Control: The `onlyOwner` modifier only checks if the `msg.sender` is the owner but does not revert the function call if it's not. This leads to functions that should be restricted to the owner to be accessible by anyone.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The low-level `call` method is used in `proxy` function of `Proxy` contract without checking its return value. If the call fails, the contract will not be aware of it.

4. Denial of Service: The `withdraw` function can be blocked by a malicious contract rejecting the transfer. This would block all users from withdrawing their funds.

5. Arithmetic Issues: No safe math library is used for arithmetic operations. This could lead to integer overflows or underflows.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable in this contract.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable in this contract.

8. Time manipulation: Not applicable in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable in this contract.

Overall, this contract needs significant improvements to avoid potential attacks and vulnerabilities. It's advisable to use well-audited community standard libraries for common operations such as arithmetic operations and safe transfers.
