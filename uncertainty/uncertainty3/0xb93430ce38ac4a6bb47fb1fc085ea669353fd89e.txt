The provided smart contract code appears to have at least two vulnerability issues as per the nine common vulnerabilities mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: In the `CashOut` function, the contract is calling an external contract (with `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`) before it has updated the `balances` state variable. This may allow a malicious contract to continuously call the `CashOut` function before the `balances` state variable has been updated, thereby draining the contract of Ether.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract is using a low-level call (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`) in the `CashOut` function without checking the return value. If this call fails for any reason, the contract will not be aware and will continue executing. This could lead to unexpected behavior.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: Updating the `balances` state variable before making the external call can prevent the problem. This is known as the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern in Solidity.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: Check the return value of the low-level call to ensure it was successful. If not, revert the transaction or handle the failure appropriately.

It's important to note that this analysis might not be exhaustive, as other vulnerabilities could be present but not detected with the provided information.
