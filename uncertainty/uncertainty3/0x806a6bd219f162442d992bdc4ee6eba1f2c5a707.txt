The given smart contract shows several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This is present in the GetPie() function. If msg.value > 1 ether, it first transfers the balance of the contract to the Owner, and then to the msg.sender. If the Owner is a contract that has a fallback function which calls GetPie() again, it could drain the contract's balance. 

2. Access Control: The contract doesn't have any restrictions on who can execute the GetPie() function. Anyone can call it and potentially drain the contract's balance if they send more than 1 ether. The withdraw() function has an access control vulnerability as it allows changing the owner of the contract without any checks. 

3. Arithmetic Issues: Not present in the contract. 

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses a low-level call in the Command() function. The return value of this call is not checked, which means it could fail silently.

5. Denial of Service: Not present in the contract. 

6. Bad Randomness: Not present in the contract. 

7. Front-Running: Not present in the contract. 

8. Time manipulation: Not present in the contract. 

9. Short Address Attack: Not present in the contract.

Consider the following suggestions to mitigate these vulnerabilities:

1. For Reentrancy, use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. Ensure all internal state changes before external calls are made.

2. For Access Control, ensure only authorized users can execute functions. In this case, only the Owner should be able to execute the GetPie() function.

3. For Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls, always check the return value of a call and handle failure cases properly.

4. Updating the Solidity compiler version to the latest one can also help as many vulnerabilities are fixed in new releases.
