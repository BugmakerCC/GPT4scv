Upon analyzing the smart contract, some potential vulnerabilities and areas of concern can be noted, however it would require more detailed analysis to confirm their exploitability:

1. Reentrancy: The `payout()`, `donateToWhale()`, and `loseWager()` functions are using the `call.value` method to send Ether, which is susceptible to reentrancy attacks, as it allows the execution of fallback functions in the recipient contract.

2. Access Control: The contract seems to have proper access control implemented via the `onlyOwner` modifier used in certain functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: No clear arithmetic issues are observed in this contract. However, the contract does not use SafeMath library which is a common practice to prevent integer overflow and underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `call.value` method does not check the return value which can lead to unchecked-send vulnerability.

5. Denial of Service: The `donateToWhale()` and `loseWager()` functions could potentially be used to force the contract into a state where it runs out of gas if the whale's contract always fails, preventing other functions from being executed.

6. Bad Randomness: In the `play()` function, the contract uses the `keccak256` hash of the blockhash and sender address to generate a random number. This is bad practice as miners can manipulate these values.

7. Front-Running: The contract may be vulnerable to front-running attacks as the `wager()` function depends on the order of transactions.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses `block.number` as a timestamp. This can be manipulated by miners to a certain extent.

9. Short Address Attack: It doesn't seem to be an issue in this contract as the contract does not take the length of the address as an input which is usually the cause of such an attack.

Please note that these assessments are based on an initial analysis. A thorough audit by an experienced security auditor is recommended to confirm these vulnerabilities and identify any additional issues.
