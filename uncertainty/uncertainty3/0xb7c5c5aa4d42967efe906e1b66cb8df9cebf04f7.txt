The contract appears to have a Reentrancy vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from the fact that when a contract sends Ether with a `call.value()()` function, the control is handed over to the called contract, which can in turn call back into the original contract. This could potentially lead to a situation where the funds are drained before the original function call even finishes. 

The withdraw function in the contract transfers Ether back to the sender before it sets their balance to 0. An attacker could create a contract that calls the withdraw function recursively before the first call finishes, draining more Ether than they have balance for.

To fix this, you should first set the balance to 0, and then transfer the funds. This way, if a reentrant call is attempted, their balance will already be 0 and the call will fail. Here is the fix:

```solidity
function withdraw() public {
    uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
    balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    msg.sender.call.value(amount)();
}
```

Also, it's better to use the `transfer()` function instead of `call.value()()`. The `transfer()` function throws an exception on failure, which revert the transaction changes, while `call.value()()` returns a boolean status code.

```solidity
function withdraw() public {
    uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
    balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    msg.sender.transfer(amount);
}
```

This contract doesn't seem to exhibit the other vulnerabilities mentioned, but a thorough audit would involve checking for all of them systematically.
