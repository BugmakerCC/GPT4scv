The smart contract has multiple vulnerabilities. Here are a few of them:

1. Reentrancy: The function `withdraw` is vulnerable to reentrancy. The state of the contract (i.e., `Deposits[msg.sender]`) is updated after the `transfer` is called. This allows a malicious contract to repeatedly call `withdraw`, draining the contract of Ether before the `Deposits[msg.sender]` is updated.

2. Access Control: The `Owner` state variable is declared twice, once in the `Proxy` contract and once in the `VaultProxy` contract. This could lead to confusion and potential errors. Furthermore, the `proxy` function in the `Proxy` contract doesn't have an `onlyOwner` modifier, meaning any address can call it.

3. Unchecked Return Values: The `target.call.value(msg.value)(data);` in the `proxy` function doesn't check the return value of the call, which could potentially fail silently.

4. Denial of Service: If a contract is called via the `proxy` function and it throws an exception or consumes all gas, it would halt execution of the `proxy` function and potentially lock the contract.

5. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not prevent overflow or underflow in the `deposit` function where it increases `Deposits[msg.sender]`. 

6. Time Manipulation: There's no time manipulation vulnerability in this contract.

7. Front-Running: There is a potential front-running vulnerability in the `withdraw` function, where someone could see a pending withdrawal transaction and get their transaction mined before it.

8. Bad Randomness: There's no randomness involved in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract does not seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack because it does not take address input from users and manually slice it.

10. The `Vault` function is supposed to be a constructor for the contract but is not declared as constructor. As a result, anyone can call this function and become the owner of the contract. This is a critical security flaw.

The contract needs significant modifications to fix these vulnerabilities.
