After analyzing the smart contract code, some potential vulnerabilities and problematic areas are as follows:

1. Reentrancy: There is a potential reentrancy vulnerability in the `payout`, `donateToWhale` and `loseWager` functions. They first send funds (`call.value` and `transfer`) and then update the contract state (`totalDonated += amount;`). An attacker could potentially exploit this by causing the called contract to call back into the original contract before the state is updated.

2. Access Control: The contract seems to be well-protected with the `onlyOwner`, `onlyRealPeople`, and `onlyPlayers` modifiers. However, there are no checks for the `whaleAddress` in the constructor, potentially leading to a scenario where a wrong address is set up as the "whale".

3. Arithmetic Issues: No apparent integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities were detected.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: There is a low-level `call` in `donateToWhale` and `loseWager` functions which doesn't check for its return value. If this call fails, the contract will not be aware of it.

5. Denial of Service: No apparent Denial of Service vulnerabilities were detected.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses `blockhash(blockNumber)` combined with `msg.sender` for generating a random number. This is predictable and can be manipulated by miners.

7. Front-Running: There is a front-running vulnerability where a miner can manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses `block.number` to calculate `blockNumber` which can be manipulated by the miners.

9. Short Address Attack: No apparent Short Address Attack vulnerabilities were detected.

Please note that this analysis might not be exhaustive and further testing and auditing might reveal more vulnerabilities.
