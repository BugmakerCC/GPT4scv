The smart contract provided has several vulnerabilities:

1. Unchecked Return Values: The contract uses `call` method to invoke `transferFrom` function of the token contract, but it does not check the return value of the function. If `transferFrom` fails, the contract will not be aware of it. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

2. Reentrancy: The contract is potentially vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. If the called contract's `transferFrom` method calls back into `AirDropContract`, it could cause unexpected behavior.

3. Access Control: The `transfer` function does not have any access control mechanisms in place. This means that anyone can call this function and potentially drain funds from the contract.

4. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not use safe math operations. This may lead to integer overflow or underflow issues.

5. Denial of Service: If an attacker can cause the `transferFrom` function to always fail, they can prevent the `AirDropContract` from functioning correctly.

6. Front-Running: Since blockchain transactions are public, an attacker could see a pending transaction calling this contract's `transfer` function and make a competing transaction with a higher gas price, causing their transaction to be processed first.

7. Bad randomness: Not applicable in this contract as there's no use of randomness.

8. Time manipulation: Not applicable in this contract as there's no dependence on block timestamp.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not check the length of the input addresses, which could make it vulnerable to a short address attack. 

Please note that these vulnerabilities might not be exploitable depending on the context in which the contract is used. Always ensure to mitigate as many vulnerabilities as possible to ensure the security of the contract.
