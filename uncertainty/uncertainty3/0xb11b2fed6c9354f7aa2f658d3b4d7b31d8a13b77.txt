This smart contract seems to have some vulnerabilities, let's examine them:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy in the `withdraw` function. The state is not updated before the call. The attacker can call the contract recursively to drain the contractâ€™s ETH.

2. Access Control: There is an access control vulnerability. The `onlyOwner` modifier is used in the `Proxy` contract, but its definition is ambiguous as the `Owner` is declared again in the `DepositProxy` contract. It's unclear which owner it refers to.

3. Arithmetic Issues: No arithmetic issues are present in this contract.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses a low-level call in the `proxy` function without checking its return value. If the call fails, the contract won't be able to handle it.

5. Denial of Service: The contract is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack since there are no loops that could consume gas until the limit is reached.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness, thus it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: There are no transaction ordering dependencies in this contract, so it's not vulnerable to front-running attacks.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on time-sensitive operations, so it's not vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.

9. Short Address Attack: There are no off-chain calls that could lead to a short address attack.

In conclusion, the smart contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, unchecked low-level calls and has ambiguous access control.
