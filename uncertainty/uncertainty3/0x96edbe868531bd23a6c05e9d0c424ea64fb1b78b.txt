The smart contract provided has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The Collect function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it calls an external contract (with msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) before it updates the state variable (with acc.balance-=_am;). An attacker can create a fallback function in their contract to call the Collect function again before the state variable is updated.

2. Access Control: The functions SetMinSum, SetLogFile and Initialized do not have any access control. Anyone can call these functions and modify the state of the contract. 

3. Arithmetic Issues: The Put function could potentially suffer from an integer overflow issue. If msg.value + acc.balance is greater than the maximum value that uint can hold, this will cause the balance to roll over to a small number.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The call method used in the Collect function does not check the return value. This could hide failures that occur during the execution of the call. 

5. Denial of Service: An attacker can make the contract unusable by setting a large unlockTime in the Put function. 

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable as there is no randomness in the contract.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable as there are no transactions dependent on the order they are included in a block.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract is vulnerable to time manipulation as it uses the now keyword which can be manipulated by miners.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable as the contract does not take an address as input.

In conclusion, the contract needs to be revised to address these vulnerabilities. The use of best practices and security patterns such as access controls, checks-effects-interactions, safe math, and timestamps should be considered.
