The given smart contract seems to have the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The functions `WithdrawToken` and `WithdrawToHolder` can potentially be exploited for a reentrancy attack because they call external contracts (with `token.call` and `_addr.call.value(_wei)` respectively) after the state changes. The external contracts could call back into these functions before they end execution, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

2. Access Control: The contract uses a simple access control mechanism (the `onlyOwner` modifier) which may not provide sufficient control or security. It would be more secure to use a role-based access control mechanism.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There is no check against underflow when the `Holders[_addr]-=_wei;` operation is performed in `WithdrawToHolder` function. If `_wei` is larger than `Holders[_addr]`, it would underflow and result in a very large balance.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract makes low-level calls with `token.call` and `_addr.call.value(_wei)`, but doesn't check their return values. If these calls fail, the contract won't be aware.

5. Denial of Service: If an attacker becomes the owner, they could prevent withdrawals by always causing the `token.call` and `_addr.call.value(_wei)` calls to fail, thereby denying service to legitimate users.

6. Bad Randomness: Does not apply as this contract does not make use of random numbers.

7. Front-Running: Does not apply as this contract does not have transaction ordering dependence.

8. Time Manipulation: Does not apply as this contract does not rely on timestamps or block numbers.

9. Short Address Attack: Does not apply as the contract does not take in user-provided addresses as input.

In conclusion, this contract has potential vulnerabilities related to reentrancy, access control, arithmetic issues, unchecked return values, and denial of service. These should be addressed for better security.
