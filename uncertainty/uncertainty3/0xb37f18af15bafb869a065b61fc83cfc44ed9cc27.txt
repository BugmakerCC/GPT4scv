1. Reentrancy: The smart contract is vulnerable to Reentrancy attack in the `sendMoney` function. The contract is calling an external contract through `_target.call.value(_value)()` and it is not following the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which states that you should make any state changes before calling external contracts.

2. Access Control: There is no Access Control vulnerability in the given smart contract. The contract uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access to certain functions to only the contract owner.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There is no Arithmetic Issues vulnerability in the given smart contract. The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could result in overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The smart contract is vulnerable to this. The low level `.call()` method used in `sendMoney` function does not check the return value. If this call fails, the contract will not be aware of it.

5. Denial of Service: The smart contract is vulnerable to Denial of Service attack. If the owner of the contract becomes a contract which doesn't have a payable fallback function, `withdrawAll` and `sendMoney` functions will be stuck.

6. Bad Randomness: There is no Bad Randomness vulnerability in the given smart contract. The contract does not utilize random numbers.

7. Front-Running: There is no Front-Running vulnerability in the given smart contract. The contract does not have any transactions that could be vulnerable to front-running.

8. Time manipulation: There is no Time manipulation vulnerability in the given smart contract. The contract does not rely on timestamps or block numbers.

9. Short Address Attack: There is no Short Address Attack vulnerability in the given smart contract. The contract does not handle raw addresses, only address types, so short address attack is not possible.
