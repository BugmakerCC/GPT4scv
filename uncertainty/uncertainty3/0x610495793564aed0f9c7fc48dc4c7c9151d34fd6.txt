The provided smart contract has a few vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the `withdraw` function. This function transfers Ether to `msg.sender` without first reducing the balance of the sender. If the recipient of this transfer is a malicious contract, it can call back into `withdraw` before the first call is finished, effectively draining the contract of all its funds.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `sendMoney` function uses the `call.value` function without checking its return value. If the call fails for any reason, the contract will not be aware of it and continue execution. This could lead to unexpected behavior.

3. Access Control: Though this contract implements an `onlyOwner` modifier for critical functions, it lacks a function to change the owner. If the owner's private key is lost or compromised, control of the contract is permanently lost. 

4. Denial of Service: Since the contract does not limit the number of deposits, an attacker could make a large number of deposits to the fallback function, increasing the `depositsCount` variable to a very high value. This could make the contract unusable for other users due to Ethereum's gas limit.

5. Arithmetic Issues: The `depositsCount` variable could potentially overflow if the fallback function is called enough times.

The contract does not appear to be vulnerable to Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time Manipulation or Short Address Attack. However, without knowing more about the contract's use case, it's hard to say for certain.
