Looking at the smart contract, several potential vulnerabilities stand out:

1. Reentrancy: The smart contract seems to be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The functions `request`, `deliver`, and `cancel` call external contracts and do not have reentrancy guards, which could potentially lead to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract uses `requests[0].requester` for access control, which is potentially dangerous as it relies on the data stored in the contract. If there is a bug in the contract that allows an attacker to modify `requests[0].requester`, they could gain unauthorized control.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not seem to check for overflows or underflows when doing arithmetic operations. This might lead to integer overflow and underflow issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values: Low-level calls such as `call.value` are used without checking their return values. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if these calls fail.

5. Denial of Service: If an attacker is able to repeatedly call the `request` function with low gas fees, it might prevent legitimate users from using the contract due to gas limit being reached.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable as this contract does not seem to use any randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to front-running attacks as it does not seem to involve any transaction ordering dependence.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to time manipulation as it does not rely on block.timestamp or block.number for critical operations.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable as this contract does not seem to directly handle user addresses in a way that would make it vulnerable to short address attacks. However, this depends on the implementation of the external contracts being called.
