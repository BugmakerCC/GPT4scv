The smart contract provided has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function "multiplicate" allows for a potential reentrancy vulnerability. When the "adr.transfer(this.balance+msg.value)" gets called, the contract's state has not been updated yet, and this can allow the called contract to reenter and drain the contract of ether.

2. Access Control: In the function "Command", the owner can execute any arbitrary function with any parameters in any contract, this could lead to serious security issues.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There is a potential integer overflow in the "multiplicate" function. If "this.balance + msg.value" exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256, it will wrap around to zero.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The low level call "adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)" in the "Command" function doesn't check the return value. This could allow silent failing of the function.

5. Denial of Service: If a malicious contract is called via the "multiplicate" function, it can refuse to complete, consuming all gas and preventing further operations.

6. Bad Randomness: This contract does not involve randomness.

7. Front-Running: This contract does not seem to be vulnerable to front running as it doesn't involve transaction ordering dependence.

8. Time manipulation: This contract does not rely on timestamps, therefore it's not vulnerable to this kind of attack.

9. Short Address Attack: Since all address inputs are provided by the contract owner, it's unlikely to be vulnerable to the short address attack. However, it's important to validate address length in a more complex contract. 

This shows that even a simple contract can have multiple vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct a thorough security audit before deploying a contract.
