This contract has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the `withdrawEther` and `withdrawTokens` functions. An attacker could recursively call the `withdrawEther` function before the first invocation of the function finishes, thus draining the contract of its ether.

2. Access Control: There are no access controls on the `withdrawEther`, `withdrawTokens`, and `getTokens` functions. This means that any address can call these functions and potentially drain the contract of its ether and tokens.

3. Arithmetic Issues: This contract does not appear to have issues related to integer overflow or underflow as it doesn't perform any arithmetic operations.

4. Unchecked Return Values: The contract does not check the return value of the `transfer` function in the `Token` contract. If this function were to fail for any reason, the `EtherGet` contract would not be aware of it.

5. Denial of Service: The contract could potentially be a victim of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. If an attacker were to make the `getTokens` function call itself recursively, it could potentially consume all available gas and block legitimate transactions.

6. Bad Randomness: This contract does not seem to rely on randomness, so this vulnerability may not be applicable.

7. Front-Running: This contract may be susceptible to front-running attacks, as the order of transactions could impact the outcome of the `withdrawTokens` and `getTokens` functions.

8. Time manipulation: This contract does not rely on block timestamps (`now` keyword in Solidity), so it's not vulnerable to this kind of attack.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract does not seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack because it does not perform raw byte operations. But in general, it's better to use Solidity's built-in functions for transferring ether or tokens, which have protections against this kind of attack.

Recommend to add necessary checks and access controls and always check the return value of `transfer` function calls.
