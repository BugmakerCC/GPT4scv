1. Reentrancy: The `redeem` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The contract sends out funds with `msg.sender.transfer(this.balance)` before its internal state is updated which can lead to reentrancy attacks. 

2. Access Control: The `withdraw` function only checks if the `msg.sender` is the owner of the contract before executing, but the owner can be changed in the same function by anyone knowing the hardcoded address, which is a security issue.

3. Arithmetic Issues: No issues found.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: In the `Command` function, a low-level `call` is used without checking its return value, which could be false if the call fails. This could lead to unexpected behavior.

5. Denial of Service: No Denial of Service issues found.

6. Bad Randomness: No issues related to randomness found.

7. Front-Running: The contract doesn't have explicit front-running vulnerabilities, but Ethereum itself is vulnerable to front-running, so all transactions might be at risk.

8. Time manipulation: No issues related to time manipulation found.

9. Short Address Attack: No issues related to short address attacks found. 

Please note that this analysis relies on the provided code only. It's possible that interactions with other contracts could open additional vulnerabilities. This is especially relevant for the `Command` function, which can interact with arbitrary addresses and execute any code.
