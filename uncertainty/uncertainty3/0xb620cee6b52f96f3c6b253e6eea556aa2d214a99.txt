After a careful review of your smart contract, I've identified the following potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `winPrize()` function is prone to reentrancy attacks as it is making an external call to the owner without adjusting the balance first. The same applies to the `manipulateSecret()` function where `msg.sender.transfer(amount);` is called without adjusting the balance.

2. Access Control: The onlyOwner modifier is used in the `winPrize()` and `setSecret()` functions but not in other critical functions such as `manipulateSecret()`, `addSeed()`, and `setSeed()`. This could lead to unauthorized access.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There's a risk of underflow/overflow in the `guessSeed()` function where the seed is divided by the product of two other seeds.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: Low-level calls like `firstTarget.call.value(msg.value)();` and `secondTarget.call.value(msg.value)();` are used without checking their return values. This makes the contract susceptible to silent failing sends.

5. Denial of Service: The `claimPrize()` function could be used to lock funds in the contract if the winner's address is a contract with a fallback function that always throws an exception.

6. Bad Randomness: The `unlockSecret()` function uses `blockhash(block.number-1)` to generate a 'random' value. Miners can manipulate this value, leading to predictable randomness.

7. Front-Running: The `setSecret()` function is vulnerable to front-running as an attacker could see the new secret value in the mempool before it's mined and send a transaction to become the winner.

8. Time manipulation: No obvious time manipulation issues found.

9. Short Address Attack: No obvious short address attack issues found.

Please consider these potential vulnerabilities and make necessary adjustments to the smart contract to improve its security.
