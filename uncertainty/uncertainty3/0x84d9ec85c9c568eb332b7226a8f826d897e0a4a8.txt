The smart contract code provided seems to be fairly well constructed, but there are a couple of potential vulnerabilities I can identify:

1. Reentrancy Vulnerability - The `execute` function in the `Owned` contract uses the `call.value` function which is susceptible to Reentrancy attacks. An attacker can construct a fallback function in their contract to call back into the `execute` function, potentially draining the contract's Ether.

2. Access Control Vulnerability - The `changeOwner` function in the `Owned` contract does not check whether the `_newOwner` address is a zero address or not. If the owner mistakenly sets the `_newOwner` to the zero address, the contract will become ownerless and be stuck in a state where no one can call the functions with the `onlyOwner` modifier.

3. Arithmetic Issues - The contract does not seem to have any arithmetic operations, so it's safe from issues like integer overflow and integer underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls - The `execute` function in the `Owned` contract does not check the return value of the `call.value` function. If this call fails for some reason, the contract will not be aware of it.

5. Denial of Service - The contract does not seem to have any potential for a Denial of Service attack.

6. Bad Randomness - The contract does not use any randomness, so it's safe from this type of attack.

7. Front-Running - The contract does not seem to have any functions that would be vulnerable to front-running.

8. Time manipulation - The contract uses the `now` keyword (alias for `block.timestamp`). This can be manipulated by miners to some degree but it's unlikely to cause major issues in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack - The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack, because it doesn't take address as a parameter from external calls.

Please note that this is a preliminary analysis and other potential security vulnerabilities may exist in the contract. It is advised to have a comprehensive audit by a professional security auditor.
