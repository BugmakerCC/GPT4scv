The contract seems to have a Reentrancy vulnerability, which is a common security issue in Ethereum smart contracts. 

In the `CashOut` function, it first sends Ether to `msg.sender` and then reduces the balance of `msg.sender`. If `msg.sender` is a contract, it can call `CashOut` again before the balance is reduced. This can lead to an attack where the attacker drains the contract's Ether even though they don't have sufficient balance. 

To mitigate this, the contract should first reduce the balance, and then send the Ether. This can be done by reordering the lines in the `CashOut` function to:

```
    function CashOut(uint _am)
    public
    payable
    {
        if(_am<=balances[msg.sender])
        {
            balances[msg.sender]-=_am;
            if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
            {
                TransferLog.AddMessage(msg.sender,_am,"CashOut");
            }
        }
    }
```

Moreover, the `CashOut` function uses a low-level call (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`) which can lead to unexpected behavior if the receiving contract throws an exception. It's recommended to use `transfer` or `send` instead, which handles exceptions and provides a safer way to send Ether. 

The contract doesn't seem to have a timestamp dependence, bad randomness, or access control issues. However, a thorough review and testing process should be performed to ensure its security, as this analysis is based on manual code review.
