After reviewing the provided smart contract, I found the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `Collect` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The balance of the sender is not updated until after the external call to `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This allows the callee to re-enter the `Collect` function before the state (balances) is updated.

2. Access Control: The `SetMinSum` and `SetLogFile` functions are publicly accessible and can be called by anyone. There is a check if `initialized` is true then it will throw an error, but it can still be called before the contract is initialized which can lead to unauthorized access.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not handle potential overflow or underflow issues. For example, in the `Deposit` function, the balance of a sender is increased without checking for potential overflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not check the return value of the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` call in the `Collect` function. If this call fails, the function will continue executing.

5. Denial of Service: If an attacker has a large balance in the contract, they could potentially cause a denial of service by causing the `Collect` function to run out of gas.

6. Time Manipulation: Although not directly in this contract, the `LogFile` contract logs the current time (`now`). This timestamp can be manipulated by miners, which could potentially lead to incorrect data.

7. Bad randomness: There is no use of randomness in the contract, so this vulnerability is not present.

8. Front-Running: There is no transaction ordering dependency in the contract, so this vulnerability is not present.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not appear to be vulnerable to short address attacks as it does not make raw `msg.data` calls.

Please note that this is a preliminary analysis and a more thorough audit may uncover more potential vulnerabilities.
