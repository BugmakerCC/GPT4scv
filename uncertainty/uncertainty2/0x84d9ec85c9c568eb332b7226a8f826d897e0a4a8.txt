Upon analyzing the provided smart contract, the following potential vulnerabilities are detected:

1. Reentrancy: The function `execute` in the `Owned` contract uses a low-level `.call` method to make an external call to another contract. The function does not prevent reentrant calls, which could potentially lead to a reentrancy attack. This could be mitigated using a Mutex or Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.

2. Access Control: The `writeIndex` function in the `WedIndex` contract is unrestricted, meaning any address can call it. This could be a problem if the functionality of this function needs to be restricted to certain roles or users.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not seem to have arithmetic operations that could lead to an overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses low-level `.call` in the `execute` function without checking its return value. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not seem to have any potential Denial of Service vulnerabilities.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not seem to use any randomness that could be manipulated by a miner or participant.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not seem to have any functions vulnerable to front-running as there are no transactions dependent on the order of execution.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) in the `writeIndex` function. This could be manipulated by miners to a certain degree, which could potentially impact the contract behavior.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to this attack as it doesn't deal with raw byte inputs for addresses.

Please note that this analysis assumes the contract is being used as intended by its author. A more detailed review could uncover additional issues or false positives. Always consult with a qualified solidity developer or auditor when dealing with smart contracts.
