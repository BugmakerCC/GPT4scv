The smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The call to `msg.sender.transfer(amount)` in the `withdraw` function of `VaultProxy` contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks. An attacker could create a fallback function in their contract to call `withdraw` again before the first call to `withdraw` has finished. This would allow them to withdraw more ether than they should.

2. Access Control: The `onlyOwner` modifier is only checked against the `Owner` in the `Proxy` contract, meaning that any function using this modifier in the `VaultProxy` contract is not actually protected because `VaultProxy` has its own `Owner` address.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There is no safe math library used in the `deposit` function, which could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `target.call.value(msg.value)(data)` in the `proxy` function doesn't check its return value. If the call fails, the contract will not be aware of it.

5. Denial of Service: If an attacker becomes the `Owner`, they could prevent legitimate users from withdrawing their funds.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable, as the contract does not use randomness.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable, as the contract does not rely on external data/conditions for transactions.

8. Time manipulation: Not applicable, as the contract does not use block timestamp or block number.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable, as the contract does not interact with user-supplied addresses in a way that would facilitate a short address attack.

In addition to these vulnerabilities, the `VaultProxy` contract also has a constructor misnaming issue. The constructor is named `Vault`, which is not the same as the contract name. This means it won't act as a constructor and will be callable as a regular function.
