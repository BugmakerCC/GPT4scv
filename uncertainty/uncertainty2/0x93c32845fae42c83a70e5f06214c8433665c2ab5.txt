After reviewing the provided smart contract, there are several potential vulnerabilities identified:

1. **Reentrancy:** The function `Collect` can be prone to a reentrancy attack because it makes an external call to `msg.sender` before it reduces the balance of `acc`. An attacker can create a fallback function in their contract to call `Collect` again before the first call has finished, effectively draining the contract of Ether.

2. **Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls:** The external call to `msg.sender` is checked if it returns true or false, but there's no explicit handling in case it fails. This may lead to unexpected results.

3. **Denial of Service:** The contract relies on `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which can throw an exception in case the call stack depth of 1024 is reached or if the recipient contract runs out of gas. This could potentially block funds.

4. **Access Control:** There are no access control checks in place, which means any address can call any function. For instance, any user could call the `Put` or `Collect` function and change the state of the contract.

5. **Arithmetic Issues:** The contract does not check for underflows or overflows. For example, `acc.balance-=_am;` could potentially underflow if `_am` is greater than `acc.balance`.

6. **Time Manipulation:** This contract uses `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`), which can be manipulated by miners to some degree. If the miners are malicious, they could manipulate the timestamp and affect the condition `now>acc.unlockTime`.

7. **Front-Running:** Since blockchain transactions are public, an attacker could view a pending transaction and then submit another transaction with a higher gas price, attempting to profit from information in the initial transaction.

No vulnerabilities detected for "Bad Randomness" and "Short Address Attack" in the given contract. However, these vulnerabilities should always be checked in the context of the complete system.
