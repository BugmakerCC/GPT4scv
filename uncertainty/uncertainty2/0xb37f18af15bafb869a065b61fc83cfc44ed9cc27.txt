This smart contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability is present in the `withdraw` and `sendMoney` functions. It is possible to recursively call these functions before the first execution has been completed. Here, `msg.sender.transfer(_value)` and `_target.call.value(_value)()` can potentially be used to call back into the contract before state changes have been made. This could lead to multiple withdrawals, resulting in a loss of funds.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The low-level call in the `sendMoney` function is not checked for its return value. If the call fails, the contract won't be aware and this could lead to unexpected behavior.

3. Denial of Service: The `sendMoney` function is potentially exposed to a Denial of Service attack. If a contract is called via the `sendMoney` function and it consumes all the gas or throws an exception, it can block the entire contract, making the funds inaccessible.

4. Access Control: There is no access control vulnerability as the owner is the only one who can withdraw money or send money. However, if the ownership of the contract is not properly managed outside of this code, it could become a vulnerability.

The other mentioned vulnerabilities - Arithmetic Issues, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, and Short Address Attack - do not appear to be present in this code.
