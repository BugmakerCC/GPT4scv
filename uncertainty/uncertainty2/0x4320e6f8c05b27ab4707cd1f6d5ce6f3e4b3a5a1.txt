The contract provided appears to have the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function. The balance of the `msg.sender` is decreased after the call to `msg.sender`, this means that a malicious contract could continually call `Collect` and drain the contract of funds before the balance is updated.

2. Access Control: The contract lacks explicit access control, allowing any address to call the `SetMinSum`, `SetLogFile`, `Initialized` functions. This could allow a malicious actor to change significant parameters in the contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: No overflow or underflow checks are implemented in the `Deposit` function, which could lead to unexpected behaviour if the balance exceeds the maximum uint256 value.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not check the return value of the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `Collect` function, which could fail silently.

5. Denial of Service: No specific Denial of Service vulnerabilities are visible, but the lack of gas usage control could potentially lead to issues.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable as the contract does not rely on randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract may be vulnerable to front-running attacks as transaction parameters are public.

8. Time manipulation: Not applicable as the contract does not rely on timestamps.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable as the contract does not take address inputs from users.

Please note that this is a preliminary analysis and further auditing of the contract is recommended.
