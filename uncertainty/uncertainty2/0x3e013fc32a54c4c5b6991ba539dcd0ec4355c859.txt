The smart contract provided has multiple potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `multiplicate` function calls `adr.transfer(this.balance+msg.value)`. If the address `adr` is a contract, it could potentially call back into `multiplicate` before the first call is finished. This is known as a reentrancy attack and could lead to funds being drained from the contract.

2. Access Control: The `withdraw` and `Command` functions are only protected by a simple check that `msg.sender == Owner`. If the owner address is compromised, an attacker could withdraw all funds or execute arbitrary calls.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The expression `this.balance+msg.value` in the `multiplicate` function could potentially overflow, leading to unexpected behavior.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);` in `Command` function is a low level call without checking its return value. If it fails, the contract won't know and could continue executing.

5. Denial of Service: If an attacker keeps the contract balance low, legitimate users could be prevented from successfully calling `multiplicate`.

6. Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, and Short Address Attack vulnerabilities do not seem to be present in this contract.

It's recommended to address these issues by using safer programming practices, like using the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, implementing reentrancy guards, and checking the return value of external calls.
