The smart contract provided is susceptible to the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function 'transfer' is making a call to an external contract (caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v);). This external call could potentially call back into the contract leading to a Reentrancy attack.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract is using low-level calls (caddress.call) without checking their return values. If the called contract rejects the execution (returns false), the current contract will not be aware of it and continue execution.

3. Access Control: The 'transfer' function has no access controls in place. Any account can call this function and execute the transfer.

4. Denial of Service: The for-loop iterates over the '_tos' array. If the size of this array is large, the gas needed for the function execution might exceed the block gas limit causing a Denial of Service.

For a comprehensive and accurate assessment, other aspects of the contract and its usage should also be considered. Various tools like static analyzers, fuzzers, and formal verification tools can be used to detect these and more subtle vulnerabilities.
