The contract has a Reentrancy vulnerability. This vulnerability is presented in the `CashOut` function where the balance of the sender is deducted after the call. This allows for a recursive call, where an attacker can continuously call the `CashOut` function while the original `CashOut` is still in the stack, draining the contract of ether.

Here is how the vulnerability can be exploited:
1. The attacker calls the `CashOut` function.
2. The contract checks if the amount `_am` is less than or equal to the balance of the sender (which it is).
3. The contract sends the amount `_am` to the sender.
4. The attacker's fallback function is triggered, which calls the `CashOut` function again.
5. The contract does not know that it is in the middle of a `CashOut` function call, so it checks if `_am` is less than or equal to the attacker's balance (which it is, because the balance has not been updated yet), and sends the amount `_am` again.
6. This process can be repeated as long as the contract has funds.

To fix this, you should always update the state variables before calling external contracts or sending ether. In this case, `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` should be placed before `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This ensures that even if the fallback function calls `CashOut` again, the balance of the attacker has already been deducted and the contract will not send more ether. 

There is also an unchecked return value vulnerability in the `CashOut` function. It does not handle the return value of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. If this call fails, the contract continues execution as if it did not. A `require()` function should be used to check that this call does not fail. 

Lastly, the contract does not have any access control mechanisms. This means that anyone can call the `AddMessage` function in the `Log` contract. To prevent unauthorized access, only the `ETH_VAULT` contract should be able to call this function. This can be implemented using the `onlyOwner` modifier in Solidity.
