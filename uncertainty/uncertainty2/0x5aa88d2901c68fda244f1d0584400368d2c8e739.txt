The identified vulnerabilities of the provided smart contract are:

1. Reentrancy: There is a Reentrancy vulnerability in the 'multiplicate' function. The 'adr.transfer()' function calls an external contract and before it, there is a state change (the contract's balance). If the called contract calls back the 'multiplicate' function, it might drain the contract's balance. 

2. Access Control: The 'withdraw' and 'Command' functions do not have a proper access control mechanism. They are only limited to the owner of the contract. There should be a mechanism to handle cases where the owner's address is lost.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: In the 'Command' function, there is a low-level call 'adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);'. The return value of this call isn't checked, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

4. Denial of Service: The 'multiplicate' function could lead to a Denial of Service attack. If an attacker chooses an 'adr' address such that it always throws an exception when receiving Ether, then all the funds in the contract would be stuck.

5. Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, and Short Address Attack: These vulnerabilities are not present in the given smart contract. 

6. Arithmetic Issues: No arithmetic operation is performed on an unchecked input from the users. So, no such vulnerability is present.

Please note that this is a brief analysis and there might be more vulnerabilities in the contract depending on the context in which it's used. Always perform a thorough audit before deploying a smart contract.
