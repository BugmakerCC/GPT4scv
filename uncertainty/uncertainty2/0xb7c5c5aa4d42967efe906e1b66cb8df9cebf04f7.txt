This contract has a Reentrancy vulnerability. The `withdraw` function sends ether with `msg.sender.call.value(balances[msg.sender])()`, then updates the balance of `msg.sender` to zero. An attacker may reenter the function after the ether is sent but before the balance is updated to zero, withdrawing more ether than their initial balance.

To fix this vulnerability, you should update the balance before sending the ether. This is known as the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. Using `transfer` or `send` instead of `call.value` also mitigates reentrancy because they only provide a limited amount of gas to the recipient, not enough to call back into the contract.

Here's a fixed version of the contract:
```
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

contract keepMyEther {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    
    function () payable public {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
    
    function withdraw() public {
        uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}
```
This version first saves the balance in a local variable, updates the balance to zero, then sends the ether. This prevents a reentrant call from being able to withdraw more ether than intended.
