1. Reentrancy: The contract doesn't seem to have a reentrancy vulnerability as it does not make an external call before updating the state.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access to certain functions like `OpenToThePublic`, `AdjustBetAmounts`, `AdjustDifficulty` and `transferAnyERC20Token`. However, the contract does not have a function to change the owner, which could potentially become an issue if the owner loses control of their address.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract doesn't seem to have any obvious arithmetic issues such as overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract makes a low level call with `whale.call.value(amount)(bytes4(keccak256("donate()")));` in `donateToWhale` and `loseWager` functions but does not check the return value of this call. This can lead to silent failing sends.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not seem to have any obvious denial of service vulnerabilities.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses `blockhash(blockNumber)` for generating a random number in the `play` function. This is not secure as miners can manipulate blockhash.

7. Front-Running: The contract doesn't seem to have any obvious front-running vulnerabilities.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses `block.number` in the `wager` and `play` function which could potentially be manipulated by miners.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract doesn't seem to have any obvious short address attack vulnerabilities as it does not deal with raw byte data from external calls.

Please note that this analysis is not exhaustive and the contract could potentially have other security vulnerabilities. It is recommended to have the contract audited by a professional security firm.
