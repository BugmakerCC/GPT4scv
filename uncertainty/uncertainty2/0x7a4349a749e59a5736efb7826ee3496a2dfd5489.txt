After a careful review, I found the following potential vulnerabilities in the given smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability is present in the `GetFreebie` and `withdraw` functions. Both functions call `transfer` after changing the state of the smart contract. If the recipient of the transfer is a malicious contract, it could call back into `GetFreebie` or `withdraw` before the first invocation is finished. This could lead to unexpected behavior or even draining of all the funds in the contract.

2. Access Control: The `Command` function allows the owner of the contract to make arbitrary calls to any address with any data. This could potentially be exploited to call into other contracts in an unintended way.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `Command` function uses a low level `.call` method without checking its return value. If the call fails for any reason, the contract will not be aware of the failure and will continue execution.

4. Denial of Service: The `GetFreebie` function could be used to drain the contract of all its funds, potentially making it useless.

5. Bad Randomness: Not applicable, no randomness is used in the contract.

6. Front-Running: Not directly applicable, but the `GetFreebie` function could potentially be exploited by a malicious miner who could see a transaction calling this function and include their own transaction with a higher gas price to get the freebie instead.

7. Time manipulation: Not applicable, no timestamp dependence in the contract.

8. Short Address Attack: Not directly applicable as the contract does not take addresses as inputs. However, a potential attack could be made in the `Command` function if the data input is not carefully formed.

The contract should be revised to address these vulnerabilities.
