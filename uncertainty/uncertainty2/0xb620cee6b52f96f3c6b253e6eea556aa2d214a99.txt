This smart contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract has a potential reentrancy vulnerability in the `manipulateSecret` function, where it sends ETH to `msg.sender` before the function execution ends. If the sender is a contract, it could call `manipulateSecret` again before the first call is finished, draining the contract's ETH.

2. Access Control: The contract has a potential access control vulnerability. The `winPrize` function is only for the owner to call, but it uses a low-level `call` function without checking the return value, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract has a potential arithmetic issue in the `guessSeed` function where it performs a division without checking if the denominator is zero, which could lead to a divide-by-zero error.

4. Unchecked Return Values: The contract doesn't check the return value of the `call` function in the `winPrize`, `callFirstTarget`, `callSecondTarget` functions. If these calls fail, the contract will not be aware of this and will continue its execution.

5. Denial of Service: The contract has a potential denial of service vulnerability. If the owner's address is a contract that has a fallback function that always throws, then the `winPrize` function will be stuck, as every call to it will fail.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract has a potential bad randomness vulnerability in the `unlockSecret` function where it uses `blockhash` and `block.number` as a source of randomness. Miners could potentially manipulate these values.

7. Front Running: The contract has a potential front-running vulnerability. In the `setSecret` function, the owner can change the secret at any time, even after players have paid to become players. This allows the owner to always win by changing the secret after seeing other players' guesses.

8. Time Manipulation: Not applicable. The contract does not rely on timestamps or `now`.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable. The contract does not take any inputs that are directly related to the length of an address.
