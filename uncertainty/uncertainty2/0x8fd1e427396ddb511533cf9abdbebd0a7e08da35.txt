The smart contract presents multiple vulnerabilities:

1. **Reentrancy**: The `WithdrawToHolder` function has a reentrancy issue where it sends ether with `_addr.call.value(_wei);` before updating the balance with `Holders[_addr]-=_wei;`. This could allow a malicious contract to repeatedly trigger the `WithdrawToHolder` function before the balance is updated, draining the contract of ether.

2. **Unchecked Low Level Calls**: The smart contract uses `token.call` and `_addr.call.value(_wei);` without checking the return value. If these calls were to fail, the contract would not be aware and it would continue executing.

3. **Access Control**: There seems to be an issue with the `onlyOwner` modifier. The conditional statement `if(owner == msg.sender)_;` should instead be `require(msg.sender == owner);` to revert all changes if the condition is not met. In its current form, the modifier doesn't prevent non-owners from executing functions. 

4. **Arithmetic Issues**: Although this contract doesn't seem to have any clear underflow or overflow issues, it's worth noting that the contract does not use SafeMath to protect against potential future arithmetic vulnerabilities.

5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The contract could be vulnerable to a DoS attack where an attacker could repeatedly call the `WithdrawToHolder` function, each time causing it to fail and leaving the contract in a state where legitimate holders cannot withdraw.

6. **Time Manipulation**: This contract doesn't rely on timestamps, so no timestamp dependency vulnerability is present.

7. **Short Address Attack**: There is no explicit check for the length of the address provided in the input, so it's vulnerable to a short address attack.

8. **Front-running** and **Bad Randomness** vulnerabilities do not seem to be present in this contract.

Please note that this analysis might not be exhaustive, and a deeper, more comprehensive audit would be required to guarantee the contract's security.
