The smart contract code you provided has two significant vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy Vulnerability: In the 'CashOut' function, the contract sends ether to the address before it decreases the sender's balance. An attacker could exploit this by creating a contract that calls 'CashOut' recursively, draining the contract of ether before the balance is updated.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The 'call.value()' function is known to be risky because it doesn't throw an exception if the call fails but returns false instead. In this contract, the developer doesn't check the return value of the call function which could lead to unexpected behavior.

In order to fix these vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: You should always update the state variables before calling external contracts. So, swap the order of the 'balances[msg.sender]-=_am' and 'if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())' lines.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: It's safer to use the 'transfer()' function when sending ether because it automatically throws an exception if the call fails. Replace the 'if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())' line with 'msg.sender.transfer(_am)'.

Here's the improved code:

```solidity
function CashOut(uint _am)
{
    if(_am<=balances[msg.sender])
    {            
        balances[msg.sender]-=_am;
        msg.sender.transfer(_am);
        TransferLog.AddMessage(msg.sender,_am,"CashOut");
    }
}
```

Please ensure to test the changes thoroughly before deploying as these are just the detected issues, there might be other hidden issues in the contract.
