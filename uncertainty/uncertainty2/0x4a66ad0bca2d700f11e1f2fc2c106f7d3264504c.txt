This smart contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability is not present in the contract. There are no external calls that allow for reentrancy.

2. Access Control: This vulnerability exists in the contract. The transfer function can only be called by the address "0x9797055B68C5DadDE6b3c7d5D80C9CFE2eecE6c9". This could be an issue if the private key for that address is lost or compromised.

3. Arithmetic Issues: This vulnerability exists in the contract. The line of code 'v[i]*1000000000000000000' could lead to an integer overflow if v[i] is a very large number.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: This vulnerability exists in the contract. The 'call' function does not check the return value, which can lead to silent failing sends.

5. Denial of Service: This vulnerability is not present in the contract. There are no loops that could potentially run out of gas and there is no self-destruct function present.

6. Bad Randomness: This vulnerability is not present in the contract. There are no random number generators used in the contract.

7. Front-Running: This vulnerability is not present in the contract. There is no dependency on the order of transactions in the contract.

8. Time manipulation: This vulnerability is not present in the contract. The contract does not use the 'now' keyword or block.timestamp, so the contract is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: This could potentially be an issue if the contract is interacting with other contracts that do not validate the length of the address. However, this vulnerability is not directly present in this contract.
