Looking at the smart contract, several vulnerabilities can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: The function `withdraw` is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack due to the use of `call.value()`. A malicious contract could recursively call the `withdraw` function before the state (Deposits[msg.sender]) is updated, draining the contract of Ether.

2. Access Control: The `onlyOwner` modifier only checks if the `msg.sender` is the owner, but it doesn't revert the transaction if the condition is not met. This could potentially allow anyone to execute functions that should be restricted to the owner. 

3. Arithmetic Issues: There is no check for integer overflow or underflow in the `deposit` function when updating the `Deposits[msg.sender]`. 

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The low level `call.value()` is used without checking its return value in the `proxy` function. If the call fails, the contract will not be aware of it.

5. Denial of Service: The `withdraw` function can potentially be blocked if the address of the `msg.sender` is a contract with a fallback function that consumes a lot of gas or always throws an exception.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable here as there is no apparent use of randomness in the contract.

7. Front-Running: Not directly applicable here, but given the lack of access control and potential for reentrancy, a malicious actor could potentially manipulate transaction ordering to their advantage.

8. Time manipulation: Not applicable as there is no time dependency in the functions of the contract.

9. Short Address Attack: Not directly applicable here, but the contract does not validate the length of the address inputs, which could make it vulnerable to a short address attack.
