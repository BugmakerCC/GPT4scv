The contract appears to have the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: There are multiple occurrences in the contract where `call.value()` is used. This function hands over control to an external contract and therefore opens up for potential reentrancy attacks. The flag `externalCallFlag` seems to be used to prevent reentrancy, but due to the lack of mutex, it may not always be successful. 

2. Access Control: The contract does not seem to have proper access control mechanisms in place. For example, any address can call the `deliver` function, not just the `SGX_ADDRESS`. This could potentially allow a malicious actor to manipulate the state of the contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not have any checks for integer overflow or underflow. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the variables go beyond their maximum or minimum values.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses low-level calls such as `call.value()`. The return values of these calls are not checked, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

5. Denial of Service: The contract may be susceptible to gas limit attacks, as it does not impose gas limits on external function calls.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not rely on random numbers, so this vulnerability does not apply.

7. Front-Running: As the contract does not handle any sort of transactions that would be susceptible to front-running, this vulnerability is not applicable.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on block timestamps for critical functionality, so this vulnerability does not apply.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not directly interact with user-supplied addresses, so it is not vulnerable to a short address attack.

Overall, the contract has several security vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.
