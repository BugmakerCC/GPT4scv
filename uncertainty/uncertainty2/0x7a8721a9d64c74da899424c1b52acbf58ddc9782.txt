This contract appears to have multiple vulnerabilities:

1) Reentrancy: The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` before it reduces the balance of the sender. An attacker can make a recursive call to `CashOut` and drain the contract.

2) Access Control: The contract uses `tx.origin` for access control in the `onlyOwner` modifier. This is a security risk, as `tx.origin` can be manipulated by contracts that are called by the original sender. It is better to use `msg.sender` instead.

3) Arithmetic Issues: In the `Deposit` function, the balance of the sender is increased with `balances[msg.sender]+=msg.value;` without any overflow checks.

4) Unchecked Return Values for Low Level Calls: The contract does not check the return value of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `CashOut` function. If the call fails, the contract will continue execution and no error will be thrown.

5) Denial of Service: The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. If an attacker's fallback function always fails, it will be impossible for them to withdraw their balance, effectively blocking their funds.

6) Bad Randomness: There doesn't seem to be any randomness involved in this contract, so this vulnerability doesn't apply here.

7) Front-Running: Front-running could potentially be an issue if the order of transactions affects the outcome of the contract, but this does not seem to be the case in this contract.

8) Time Manipulation: The `Log` contract relies on `now` for timestamps, which can be manipulated by miners to some degree.

9) Short Address Attack: This contract does not appear to be vulnerable to a short address attack, as it doesn't take any address inputs that could be shortened.

It's recommended to address these issues before deploying the contract.
