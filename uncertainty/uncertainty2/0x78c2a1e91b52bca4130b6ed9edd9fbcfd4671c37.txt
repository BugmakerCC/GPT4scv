1. Reentrancy: The `redeem` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. It first calls `Owner.transfer(this.balance)` and then `msg.sender.transfer(this.balance)`. An attacker could become the owner and recursively call `redeem`, draining the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: The `withdraw` function is vulnerable to an access control attack. It changes the contract's owner to a hardcoded address before checking if `msg.sender == Owner`. This gives control to the hardcoded address.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract, so it is not vulnerable to Integer Overflow/Underflow attacks.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The low level call in the `Command` function doesn't check its return value. If it fails, the contract will not be aware.

5. Denial of Service: The contract is not vulnerable to DOS attacks as there isn't any loop that could consume more gas than expected.

6. Bad Randomness: This contract doesn't use randomness, so it's not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: There is no scenario where transaction order could be exploited for gain, so it's not vulnerable to front-running.

8. Time manipulation: This contract doesn't use time or block variables, so it's not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract doesn't take addresses as an input from users, so it's not vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the contract is vulnerable to Reentrancy and Access Control attacks, and fails to check the return value of a low level call.
