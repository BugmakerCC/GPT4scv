This smart contract has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `WithdrawToHolder` function uses the `.call.value()()` method, which can make the contract susceptible to a reentrancy attack. In this case, the external contract could reenter and repeatedly drain the contract's Ether before the balance is updated.

2. Access Control: The `onlyOwner` modifier is flawed. It should `require` that `msg.sender` is the owner, otherwise it should revert. But in the current implementation, it will continue to execute rest of the function even when `msg.sender` is not the owner.

3. Arithmetic Issues: While there are no noted overflow or underflow issues, it's important to use SafeMath library to ensure all mathematical operations are safe.

4. Unchecked Return Values: The low-level `call` method is used without checking the return value. If the call fails, the contract won't know and will continue execution.

5. Denial of Service: There's a potential for DOS attack. If the address of a 'Holder' is a contract which has a fallback function that always throws, then `WithdrawToHolder` function will be stuck.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable, as there is no randomness in the contract.

7. Front-running: Not directly applicable, but if the order of transactions matters (for instance, in `WithdrawToHolder`), then users could potentially manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage.

8. Time Manipulation: Not applicable, as the contract doesn't rely on block timestamps.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable, as the contract doesn't take input directly from the user for addresses or amounts.

Remember, the best way to avoid these vulnerabilities is to use established patterns and libraries (like OpenZeppelin), to thoroughly test your contract, and to have it audited by a professional.
