This smart contract seems to have the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: In the "Collect" function, the contract sends Ether with "msg.sender.call.value(_am)()" before it reduces the balance of the sender. This allows for a reentrancy attack, where the external contract could call "Collect" again before the first call has finished, causing it to withdraw more Ether than it should be able to.

2. Access Control: The functions "SetMinSum", "SetLogFile", and "Initialized" can be called by anyone since they lack a proper access control mechanism, such as the usage of the 'onlyOwner' modifier.

3. Unchecked Low Level Calls: The low level call "msg.sender.call.value(_am)()" is unchecked. Therefore, if it fails, the contract will not be aware and will continue execution.

4. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not check for potential overflows or underflows in the "Deposit" and "Collect" functions. This could lead to unexpected balances.

5. Denial of Service: If the address of the "LogFile" contract is set to an address that throws an exception, it would stop the execution of the "Deposit" and "Collect" functions, leading to a Denial of Service.

6. Front-Running: As transactions are public, an attacker could see a transaction calling the "Collect" function and then send one with a higher gas price, allowing them to execute before the original transaction.

7. Time Manipulation: The 'now' keyword is used in the 'AddMessage' function of the 'LogFile' contract. This value can be manipulated by miners, making it unreliable.

The contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to Bad Randomness and Short Address Attack. However, these vulnerabilities can be context-specific and may not be applicable in all cases.
