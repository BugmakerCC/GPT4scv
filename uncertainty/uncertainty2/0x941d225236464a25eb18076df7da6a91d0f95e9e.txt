The given smart contract seems to have at least two potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: In the 'CashOut' function, an external contract is called before the state (balance) is updated. This can allow the external contract to reenter and drain the contract if it falls into a loop, which means it's a potential reentrancy attack.

Here is how it might work: An attacker calls 'CashOut', which in turn calls the attacker's fallback function (due to the line 'msg.sender.call.value(_am)()'). If the attacker's fallback function calls 'CashOut' again before the first call to 'CashOut' has finished, it could withdraw more Ether than it should be allowed to, potentially draining the contract.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: Low-level calls such as 'call.value()' return a boolean indicating whether the call was successful or not. In the 'CashOut' function, the return value of 'call.value()' is not checked, this can lead to funds being locked in the contract if the call fails.

Please note that the contract does not seem to have any obvious vulnerabilities related to Access Control, Arithmetic Issues, Denial of Service, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, or Short Address Attack. However, a thorough security audit by a professional is always recommended.
