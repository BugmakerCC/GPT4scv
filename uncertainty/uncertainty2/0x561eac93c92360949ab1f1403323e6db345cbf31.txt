The given smart contract contains a few potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: In the `Collect` function, the contract sends Ether to `msg.sender` before deducting the amount from the sender's balance. This allows for a potential reentrancy attack. An attacker can create a fallback function in their contract to call the `Collect` function again before the first call is finished, draining the contract's funds.

2. Access Control: The `SetMinSum`, `SetLogFile`, and `Initialized` functions can be called by anyone. There are no checks to ensure that these functions can only be called by the contract owner. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the minimum sum or the log file. 

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `call.value()` function in the `Collect` function does not check the return value. If the call fails for any reason, the contract's state won't be reverted. This can lead to funds being locked in the contract.

4. Denial of Service: An attacker can make the contract unavailable by causing all transactions to run out of gas. They can do this using a fallback function that consumes a lot of gas.

5. No Time Manipulation, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Short Address Attack, and Arithmetic Issues vulnerabilities were detected in this contract.

To fix these vulnerabilities, consider implementing the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to mitigate the Reentrancy attack. For the Access Control vulnerability, add a modifier that only allows the contract owner to call certain functions. The return value of `call.value()` should also be checked and handled appropriately. Lastly, consider using a pull payment system to avoid the potential Denial of Service attack.
