Upon examining the smart contract, I detected the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdraw` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it calls `msg.sender.transfer` which is a external call to untrusted contract. In Ethereum, when you make an external call, the control is transferred to the other contract. It could call back into your contract and modify the state. An attacker could make a contract that implements a fallback function, which calls back into the `withdraw` function and drain the contract's balance.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `sendMoney` function uses a low level `.call.value()` function, without checking the return value. If this call fails, the contract will not be aware of it.

To fix these issues, for the reentrancy attack, you should make sure to update all changes to the state before calling the external contract by the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern. For example, you could first deduct the amount from the sender's balance, and then transfer the amount to the recipient.

For the unchecked low level calls, you should always check the return value of `call` function. If it returns `false`, you should handle the error, or revert the transaction. 

```solidity
require(_target.call.value(_value)(_data), "Failed external call");
```

Do note that there are other potential vulnerabilities not covered by this analysis, and it's recommended to use tools and audits for comprehensive security checks.
