The smart contract has a Reentrancy vulnerability.

In the `CashOut` function, the contract first sends Ether to `msg.sender` and then deducts the amount from the sender's balance. An attacker can create a fallback function in their own contract to call `CashOut` function again before the first call is finished.

Here's how an attack may occur:
1. Attacker calls the `CashOut` function.
2. The contract sends the Ether to the attacker's contract.
3. The attacker's contract fallback function is triggered, which again calls the `CashOut` function.
4. The contract sends the Ether to the attacker's contract again because the attacker's balance has not been deducted yet.
5. This cycle can continue as long as the contract has enough Ether.

To fix this issue, the balance should be deducted before the Ether is sent.
 
For example:
```solidity
function CashOut(uint _am)
    public
    payable
    {
        if(_am<=balances[msg.sender])
        {
            balances[msg.sender]-=_am;
            if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
            {
                TransferLog.AddMessage(msg.sender,_am,"CashOut");
            }
        }
    }
```
This contract does not appear to have other mentioned vulnerabilities such as Access Control, Arithmetic issues, Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls, Denial of Service, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation or Short Address Attack. However, it's always a good practice to have a thorough security audit by professional auditors before deploying a smart contract.
