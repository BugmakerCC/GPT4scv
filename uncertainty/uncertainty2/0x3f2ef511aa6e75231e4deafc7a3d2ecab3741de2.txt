The smart contract you provided has several potential vulnerabilities.

1. Reentrancy: The "redeem" function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. After checking if "msg.value" is greater than or equal to "minEligibility", it transfers the balance of the contract to "msg.sender". If "msg.sender" is a malicious contract that implements a fallback function to call "redeem" function again, it can drain the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: The contract uses simple address checks for access control. If the private key of the owner account is compromised, the entire contract can be taken over by the attacker. 

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no visible arithmetic issues in this contract as there are no arithmetic operations.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses a low-level call in the "Command" function without checking its return value. If the call fails, the contract execution will just continue.

5. Denial of Service: The "withdraw" function could potentially be a vector for a DoS attack. If the owner's address becomes a contract that always throws an exception, the "withdraw" function can be blocked.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any random numbers, so this vulnerability is not applicable.

7. Front-Running: As transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain before they get mined, an attacker could see a pending call to the "redeem" function and quickly send a transaction with a higher gas price to call "redeem" first.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not depend on timestamps, so this vulnerability is not applicable.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract might be vulnerable to a short address attack as it doesn't validate the length of the address inputs. But in this specific contract, the risk is not evident as it doesn't deal with token transfers. 

Please consider refactoring the smart contract to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
