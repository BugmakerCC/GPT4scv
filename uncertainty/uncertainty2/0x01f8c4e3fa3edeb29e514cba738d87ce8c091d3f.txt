The provided smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to a Reentrancy attack in the `Collect` function. The contract sends Ether with `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` before it reduces the balance of the user with `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`. This allows the recipient to call the `Collect` function recursively before the user's balance has been updated.

2. Arithmetic Issues: There doesn't seem to be any arithmetic overflow or underflow issues in the contract.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: This vulnerability is not present in the contract as all low level calls are checked.

4. Denial of Service: This vulnerability is not present in the contract.

5. Bad Randomness: The contract does not rely on randomness, so this vulnerability is not present.

6. Front-Running: This contract could be vulnerable to front-running. Since the state of the blockchain, including the balances mapping, is public, a malicious actor could observe a pending transaction where a user is trying to collect their balance and submit their own transaction with a higher gas price to collect the balance before the original user.

7. Time manipulation: The contract does not use timestamps for critical functionality, hence it is not vulnerable to this attack.

8. Short Address Attack: This contract is not vulnerable to a short address attack because it does not take address inputs from users.

9. Access Control: The contract does not properly implement access control. The contract allows anyone to call the `SetMinSum` and `SetLogFile` functions, which should be restricted to the contract owner.
