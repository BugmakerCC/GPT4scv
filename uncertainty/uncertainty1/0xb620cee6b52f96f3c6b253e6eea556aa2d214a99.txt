The given smart contract has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The functions `manipulateSecret()`, `callFirstTarget()`, `callSecondTarget()`, `winPrize()`, and `claimPrize()` are all vulnerable to Reentrancy attacks as they include a `call.value()()` or `transfer()` call which can be exploited. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to drain the contract funds.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the `onlyOwner`, `onlyWinner`, and `onlyPlayers` modifiers to access control, but these may not be sufficient to prevent unauthorized access. The modifier `onlyOwner` doesn't validate that the owner is not a zero address. Also, the `owner` of the contract can be changed in the `guessSeed()` function, which could be exploited.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The `guessSeed()` function includes an arithmetic operation without checking for underflows or overflows.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low Level Calls: The `call.value()()` methods used in `callFirstTarget()`, `callSecondTarget()`, and `winPrize()` functions do not check the return value, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

5. Bad Randomness: The contract uses `blockhash(block.number-1)` in `unlockSecret()` function to generate a random number, which is predictable and can be manipulated by miners.

6. Denial of Service: The `claimPrize()`, `manipulateSecret()`, `callFirstTarget()`, `callSecondTarget()` functions can be blocked by an attacker by making them always throw an exception.

7. Front-Running: The condition in `unlockSecret()` function can be front-run by an attacker who can see the transaction in the mempool and then send a transaction with a higher gas price.

8. Time manipulation: There is no time dependent functionality in the contract.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract is not vulnerable to a short address attack as it does not take address input from users, but uses hard-coded addresses.

One more thing to note is that the contract does not have a mechanism to stop accepting funds after the game is over. This could lead to potential loss of funds for users who send Ether to the contract after the game is over.
