The provided smart contract has at least the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `CashOut` is vulnerable to reentrancy attack. It uses a low level `.call.value()()` function to transfer Ether. An attacker can create a fallback function in their contract to call `CashOut` function again before the first call is finished. The `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` statement will not be executed until the external call finishes, and since it is after the external call, it allows for reentrancy. To fix this, the contract should first subtract the balance, and then make the external call.

2. Arithmetic Issues: Although this contract does not appear to have any obvious arithmetic issues (integer overflow and underflow), it's always a good idea to use SafeMath library for arithmetic operations for safety reasons.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: Although `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is used, the return value is checked with an `if` statement. Hence, this particular issue does not exist in this contract.

4. Denial of Service (DoS): If the address `msg.sender` is a contract and its fallback function consumes a lot of gas or reverts, the `CashOut` function will fail, and the legitimate user may never be able to withdraw their ether. This is the DoS with Unexpected Revert vulnerability.

5. Access Control: The `AddMessage` function in the Log contract can be called by anyone, which could lead to incorrect log messages.

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of potential issues. Further testing and auditing might reveal more issues.
