The contract contains the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract doesn't seem to have a direct reentrancy vulnerability as there are no external function calls within a state change. 

2. Access Control: The contract is vulnerable to Access Control issues as the transfer function can only be called by a hardcoded address (0x9797055B68C5DadDE6b3c7d5D80C9CFE2eecE6c9), which restricts the functionality of the contract to a single user.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract doesn't seem to have any obvious arithmetic issues, but it's worth noting that the multiplication operation in the transfer function could lead to a potential integer overflow issue if not properly handled.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses a low-level `call` function without checking its return value. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the `call` fails.

5. Denial of Service: The contract doesn't seem to have direct DOS vulnerabilities. However, the reliance on a single hard-coded address can be a potential DOS vector if the private key of that address is lost.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract doesn't involve any randomness, so this vulnerability doesn't apply.

7. Front-Running: The contract doesn't seem to have a direct front-running vulnerability as there are no transaction order dependencies.

8. Time manipulation: The contract doesn't rely on timestamps or block numbers, so it's not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract doesn't seem to have a short address attack vulnerability as it doesn't take any user inputs for addresses. However, always ensure to use the `transferFrom` function with care to avoid potential issues.
