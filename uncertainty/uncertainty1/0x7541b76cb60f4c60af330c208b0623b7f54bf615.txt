The smart contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `Collect` function can be called recursively because it first sends Ether to `msg.sender` and then decreases the balance of `msg.sender`. This can lead to a reentrancy attack where the attacker drains the smart contract of its Ether.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses `call.value()` which is a low-level function that does not throw an exception when the call fails but returns false instead. However, the contract does not check the return value of the call, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

3. Access Control: The `AddMessage` function in the `Log` contract can be called by anyone. This can lead to unauthorized users adding log messages.

4. Timestamp Dependence: The contract uses `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) in critical logic. Miners can manipulate timestamps to some degree, which could have an impact on the contract's behavior.

5. Gas Limit: The `Put` function is called in the fallback function without specifying a gas limit. This could lead to out-of-gas exceptions.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the contract should use a pattern like Checks-Effects-Interactions to avoid reentrancy attacks, replace low-level calls with safer high-level calls, introduce access control mechanisms to restrict who can call certain functions, replace `now` with a more reliable mechanism for time measurement, and specify a gas limit when calling functions in the fallback function.
