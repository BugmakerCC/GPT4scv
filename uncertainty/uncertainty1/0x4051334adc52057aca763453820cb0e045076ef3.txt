The provided smart contract has the following potential vulnerabilities:

1. **Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls:** The contract uses the `call` function which is a low-level function to interact with another contract. The return value of the `call` function is not checked. If the call fails, the contract will not be aware of the failure and will continue executing.

2. **Reentrancy Vulnerability:** The `call` function can potentially make the contract susceptible to reentrancy attacks. If the target contract of the `call` function calls back into this contract before the function execution is finished, it could potentially cause a state change that the function is not expecting.

3. **Access Control:** The `transfer` function is public and does not have any checks to validate who can call it. This means that anyone can call the function and pass in any parameters. This could potentially be used to maliciously transfer tokens from any address to any other address.

4. **Denial of Service:** If the array of addresses `_tos` passed to the `transfer` function is too large, it could potentially cause the function to exceed the gas limit, effectively blocking the function from being executed.

5. **Arithmetic Issues:** There are no safe math checks in place for the loop that iterates through the `_tos` array. If the array size is too large, it could potentially cause an integer overflow in the loop counter.

To fix these vulnerabilities, the contract should:

1. Check the return value of the `call` function to ensure it was successful.
2. Implement reentrancy guards to prevent reentrancy attacks.
3. Implement access control measures to restrict who can call certain functions.
4. Limit the size of the `_tos` array to prevent potential DoS attacks.
5. Implement safe math checks to prevent potential integer overflows.
