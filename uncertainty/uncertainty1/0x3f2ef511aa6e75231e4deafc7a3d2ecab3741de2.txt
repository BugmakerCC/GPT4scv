The smart contract provided has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The 'redeem' function has a reentrancy vulnerability. It transfers ether to msg.sender before updating the state, which can allow for a recursive call where an attacker can drain the contract funds.

2. Access Control: The 'withdraw' function only checks if the sender is the owner before transferring the entire balance of the contract. If the owner address is compromised, the entire contract can be drained.

3. Arithmetic Issues: This contract doesn't seem to have any arithmetic operations and therefore no apparent risk of integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: In the 'Command' function, the return value of the low-level call is not checked. If the call fails for any reason, the contract will not be aware of it.

5. Denial of Service: There doesn't seem to be an obvious Denial of Service vulnerability in this contract.

6. Bad Randomness: This contract doesn't use any random function, so there's no bad randomness vulnerability.

7. Front-Running: There is no apparent front-running vulnerability in this contract as there is no dependence on transaction ordering.

8. Time manipulation: This contract does not use timestamps or block hashes, so there is no vulnerability related to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract does not appear to be vulnerable to a short address attack as it does not take addresses as input from non-trusted sources.

However, the contract does not handle fallback function properly and the 'Command' function can expose the contract to arbitrary method calls. A better practice would be to use a more secure design pattern and follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern to avoid reentrancy attacks. It's also important to avoid using low level calls whenever possible.
