This contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the `Collect` function. The call to `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` directly sends Ether to the `msg.sender` before reducing the balance. An attacker could continuously call this function to drain the contract's funds.

2. Access Control: The `SetMinSum` and `SetLogFile` functions can be called by anyone before the contract is initialized. This allows any user to change these values. 

3. Arithmetic Issues: No safe math library is used in this contract, which could potentially lead to overflows and underflows.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` call doesn't check its return value, which means that the call could fail silently. 

5. Denial of Service: A malicious actor could possibly exploit the contract's fallback function to execute a DoS attack by sending Ether to the contract until it runs out of gas.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness, so this is not an issue in this case.

7. Front-Running: The contract is susceptible to front-running attacks due to the lack of commit-reveal scheme or using any method to prevent transaction ordering manipulation.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses `now` for timestamping messages. Miners can manipulate timestamps to some degree, but it's unlikely to be an issue in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack because it doesn't take addresses as input from function calls.
