    - The `migrate` function can be called by any user but only if migratestate is false.
    - The `refundTRA` function can be called by any user but only if funding is false and refundstate is true.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract uses SafeMath library functions for arithmetic operations which prevents integer overflow and underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not use low level calls.

5. Denial of Service: No potential denial of service attacks found.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not rely on randomness.

7. Front-Running: No potential front-running attacks found as there are no transaction ordering dependencies.

8. Time manipulation: No vulnerabilities found related to timestamp dependence.

9. Short Address Attack: No potential short address attacks found. The contract does not interact with the msg.data directly.

Please note that this analysis does not guarantee the contract is 100% secure and error-free.
