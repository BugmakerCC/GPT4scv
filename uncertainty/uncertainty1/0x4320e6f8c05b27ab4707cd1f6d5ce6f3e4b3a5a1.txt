The smart contract you provided has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: In the `Collect` function, `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` can call the contract recursively before `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` is executed. To mitigate this, the state `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` should be updated before the external call.

2. Access Control: Here, any user can call `SetMinSum`, `SetLogFile`, and `Initialized`. There are no ownership checks in place to limit who can call these functions. This can be mitigated by implementing a modifier that only allows the contract owner to call these functions.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The low level call `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` can fail silently because the return value is unchecked. This should be replaced with a safer call such as `transfer` which automatically throws on failure.

4. Denial of Service: The `Collect` function can run out of gas if too many iterations are required. This can be mitigated by using the `send` or `transfer` function instead of `call.value`.

5. Bad Randomness: There doesn't seem to be any use of randomness in this contract, so it's not vulnerable to bad randomness.

6. Front-Running: There doesn't seem to be any transactions that could be exploited by front-running.

7. Time manipulation: The contract uses `now` in `AddMessage`. This could be manipulated by miners to a certain extent. It's better to use block.number for time-related logic.

8. Short Address Attack: No explicit length checks on the address input. However, Solidity does implicit checks on address length so this contract is not vulnerable to short address attacks.

9. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit overflow checks for the arithmetic operations. This can be mitigated by using SafeMath library by OpenZeppelin as it provides safe versions of arithmetic operations. 

Overall, the contract needs significant security improvements to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
