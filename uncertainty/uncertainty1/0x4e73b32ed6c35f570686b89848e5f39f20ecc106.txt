The smart contract provided above has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `Collect(uint _am)` is vulnerable to reentrancy because it calls an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`) before it updates the state (`balances[msg.sender]-=_am`). This could potentially allow an attacker to drain the contract by recursively calling the `Collect` function before the balance is updated.

2. Access Control: The functions `SetMinSum(uint _val)`, `SetLogFile(address _log)`, and `Initialized()` do not have any access control mechanisms, which means anyone can call these functions. The contract owner should be the only one with the ability to call these functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There is potential for an integer underflow in the `Collect(uint _am)` function when the balance is subtracted `_am`. There is no check to ensure that the balance is greater than or equal to `_am` before subtraction. 

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The low-level call `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in `Collect(uint _am)` function does not check the return value. This can lead to funds being stuck in the contract if the call fails.

5. Denial of Service: If an attacker sets the `LogFile` contract to a malicious contract, it can potentially block the `Deposit` and `Collect` functions from completing, causing a denial of service.

6. Bad Randomness: N/A

7. Front-Running: N/A

8. Time manipulation: N/A

9. Short Address Attack: N/A

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, consider using `transfer` or `send` instead of `call.value()()`, adding access control to sensitive functions, checking arithmetic operations for overflows and underflows, and always checking the return value of low-level calls.
