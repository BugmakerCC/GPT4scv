The smart contract contains the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the CashOut function. Before updating the balance with `balances[msg.sender] -= _am`, the contract sends Ether to the caller with `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. If the caller's fallback function makes a reentrant call to the CashOut function, they can drain more Ether than they should be able to.

    To fix this vulnerability, the contract should follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. It should perform all state changes before calling external contracts.

2. Arithmetic Issues: The contract is vulnerable to an underflow in the CashOut function. If the balance of the sender is less than `_am`, the subtraction `balances[msg.sender] -= _am` can underflow.

    To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use SafeMath library or similar to prevent underflows and overflows.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses `call.value` which is a low level call and doesn't check the return value. If the call fails due to an exception, the contract's state will be incorrect.

    To fix this vulnerability, the contract should check the return value of `call.value` and revert the transaction if it's false.

4. Denial of Service: If the recipient of the Ether in the CashOut function is a contract and it has a fallback function that always throws, it can block all users from withdrawing their Ether.

    To fix this vulnerability, the contract can use the pull payment pattern instead of pushing payments directly.
   
5. The contract doesn't contain any randomness, time manipulation, front-running, short address attack, or access control vulnerabilities based on the given code.
