The smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The external calls to `msg.sender.call.value(msg.value)()` and `requests[requestId].requester.call.value(fee - CANCELLATION_FEE)()` allow for reentrancy, as they are followed by state changes. This could be exploited by an attacker to withdraw more funds than expected.

2. Access Control: The contract does not properly restrict who can call certain functions. For instance, anyone can call the `suspend()`, `restart()`, `withdraw()`, and `request()` functions, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There doesn't appear to be an arithmetic issue in this contract.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: Return values for low-level calls are not checked in this contract. This could lead to silent failing sends, where the contract does not realize that a send has failed.

5. Denial of Service: The contract is vulnerable to DoS attacks. For example, if an attacker continuously calls the `request()` function without paying the minimum fee, they could potentially block legitimate users from making requests.

6. Bad Randomness: There doesn't appear to be an issue with randomness in this contract.

7. Front-Running: There doesn't appear to be a front-running issue in this contract.

8. Time manipulation: There doesn't appear to be a time manipulation issue in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: There doesn't appear to be a short address attack issue in this contract.
