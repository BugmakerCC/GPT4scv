The smart contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdraw` function in the `DepositProxy` contract is susceptible to a reentrancy attack. The state variable `Deposits[msg.sender]` is not updated before the transfer is executed. Therefore, a malicious contract can re-enter the `withdraw` function and drain the contract of its funds.

2. Access Control: The `proxy` function in the `Proxy` contract allows any caller to make arbitrary calls to another contract. This could be exploited to call functions with malicious intent on the target contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There is no check for underflow in the `withdraw` function. If the `amount` is larger than `Deposits[msg.sender]`, this will underflow and result in a very large number.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `target.call.value(msg.value)(data)` in the `proxy` function does not check the return value. If the call fails, the contract will not be aware and continue execution.

5. Denial of Service: The `transferOwner` function in the `Proxy` contract could potentially lock the contract if a contract is set as the new owner. If the new owner contract does not have a function to accept ownership, this contract will be stuck.

6. Bad Randomness: There doesn't seem to be any use of randomness in this contract.

7. Front-Running: There doesn't seem to be any front-running issues in this contract.

8. Time manipulation: There doesn't seem to be any time manipulation issues in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: There are no external calls with msg.data or checks for address length, so this contract isn't vulnerable to short address attacks.
