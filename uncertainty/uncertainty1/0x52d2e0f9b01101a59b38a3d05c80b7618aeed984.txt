The given smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: 
   The withdrawEther() method is susceptible to a reentrancy attack because it calls an external method (owner.transfer) while the contract's state is not finalized. An attacker can recursively call the withdrawEther() method to drain the contract's funds.

2. Access Control: 
   The functions withdrawTokens, withdrawEther, and getTokens do not have proper access control measures in place. Any address can call these methods which could lead to unauthorized asset transfers.

3. Arithmetic Issues: 
   The smart contract does not have issues related to integer overflow and underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: 
   In the getTokens method, the low-level call method is used without checking its return value. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.

5. Denial of Service: 
   The contract is not vulnerable to the Denial of Service attack in the presented code.

6. Bad Randomness: 
   The smart contract does not have issues related to randomness.

7. Front-Running: 
   The smart contract does not seem to have vulnerabilities related to front-running, as there are no transaction ordering dependencies or time-of-check vs time-of-use issues.

8. Time manipulation: 
   The smart contract does not have vulnerabilities related to timestamp dependence.

9. Short Address Attack: 
   The smart contract does not seem to be vulnerable to the short address attack as it does not perform raw transfers of tokens (token.transfer()). However, best practice would be to include an explicit check for the length of the input addresses.
