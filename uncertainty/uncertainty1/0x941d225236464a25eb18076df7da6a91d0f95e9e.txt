This smart contract seems to be vulnerable to the following vulnerabilities:

1. Re-entrancy: The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to a re-entrancy attack because it calls an external contract (which can be a malicious contract designed to drain funds) before it updates the state (balances[msg.sender]-=_am). This means that the external call can be used to call `CashOut` again before the state is updated, allowing multiple withdrawals in a single transaction.

2. Access Control: The `AddMessage` function in the `Log` contract is public and doesn't have any access control measures in place, meaning that anyone can call it and potentially fill the storage with junk data.

3. Unchecked Return Values for Low Level Calls: The contract uses a low-level call (msg.sender.call.value(_am)()), but doesn't check its return value. If the call fails, the state won't be updated and the contract will continue to work as if everything was fine.

4. Gas limit attacks (Denial of Service): The `AddMessage` function can be called repeatedly until the gas limit is reached, potentially causing the contract to become stuck in a state where no further transactions can be processed.

5. Bad Randomness: While this contract doesn't explicitly use random numbers, the reliance on `block.number` for checking the last action could be considered as a source of randomness that can be manipulated by miners.

6. Front Running: While there's no explicit use of price or sensitive data that could be front-run, the lack of access control and re-entrancy vulnerability could be used in combination with a front-running attack.

7. Time Manipulation: The contract uses `block.number` as a way of ensuring that only one action can be performed per block. However, this can be manipulated by miners, potentially allowing multiple actions within a single block.

8. Short Address Attack: The contract doesn't check the length of the address when receiving ETH. If a user sends ETH from a short address, the contract will accept it but might send it to a different address when withdrawing because the short address gets padded with zeroes.

So, code review should be conducted to remove these vulnerabilities from the smart contract.
