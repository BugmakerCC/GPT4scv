After reviewing the provided smart contract, here are the potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: No reentrancy vulnerability is detected in this contract. The contract does not make any external calls after state changes.

2. Access Control: The contract has a solid access control mechanism through the use of the `onlyOwner` modifier. However, the `changeOwner` function can be exploited if the owner accidentally sets a wrong address. There is also no check if `_newOwner` is a non-zero address.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations, so it does not have any arithmetic-related vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `execute` function in the `Owned` contract uses a low-level call without checking its return value. This can potentially lead to unexpected behavior.

5. Denial of Service (DoS): In the `sendMessage` function, if the `owner` contract's fallback function uses more than the gas stipend (2300 gas), the `owner.transfer(this.balance);` could fail causing a DoS vulnerability.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not generate any random numbers, so it does not have any randomness-related vulnerabilities.

7. Front-Running: There is no sensitive information being transmitted in transactions that could be exploited by miners or other users.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) which can be manipulated by miners to a certain degree. However, in the context of this contract, this does not seem to pose a significant risk.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not perform raw `msg.data` length checks, so it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the contract should address the unchecked return value in the `execute` function and potential DoS in the `sendMessage` function. The `changeOwner` function should also include a check for a non-zero address before proceeding with ownership transfer.
