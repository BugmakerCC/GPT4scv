The following vulnerabilities are present in this contract:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it calls external contracts (`whale.call.value(amount)(bytes4(keccak256("donate()")));`) before updating the state of the contract. An attacker may be able to repeatedly call the function `donateToWhale` and `loseWager` before the state `totalDonated` is updated, effectively draining the contract's funds.

2. Bad Randomness: The contract uses a predictable source of randomness (`blockhash(blockNumber)`) to determine the `winningNumber`. An attacker, especially if they are a miner, can manipulate this value.

3. Access Control: There is a potential risk that the `owner` can manipulate the game by changing `difficulty` and `betLimit` at any time.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not check the return value of the `whale.call.value(amount)(...)` calls in `donateToWhale` and `loseWager` methods. This could lead to failed transactions without an exception being thrown, leading to unexpected behavior.

5. Time Manipulation: The contract relies on `block.number` for timestamping wagers. This can be manipulated by miners to a certain extent.

6. Denial of Service: The `play()` function could potentially run out of gas if the number of players (`wagers`) becomes too large, leading to a Denial of Service for all subsequent players.

7. Front Running: Players could potentially see other player's transactions in the mempool before they get mined and use this information to their advantage.

Please review and fix these vulnerabilities before deploying the contract.
