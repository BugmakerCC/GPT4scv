After analyzing the provided smart contract, I found the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The 'GetFreebie' and 'withdraw' functions are vulnerable to reentrancy attacks as they call 'transfer' before updating the state. An attacker could recursively call these functions, draining the contract's Ether.

2. Access Control: The 'Command' function is vulnerable to access control issues because it allows the contract owner to call arbitrary functions on any address, potentially resulting in malicious behavior.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not appear to have arithmetic issues such as integer overflows or underflows.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The 'Command' function uses a low-level call without checking its return value, making it vulnerable to unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not appear to have an explicit denial of service vulnerability, but a reentrancy attack can result in a denial of service by depleting the contract's gas or Ether.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not rely on randomness, so it does not have this vulnerability.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not appear to have front-running vulnerabilities as it does not depend on transaction ordering.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not depend on timestamps or block numbers, so it does not have this vulnerability.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not take address inputs from users, so it does not have this vulnerability. 

Please note, while the contract might not have some of the vulnerabilities listed, it is always a good practice to follow best practices and guidelines to ensure the security of the contract.
