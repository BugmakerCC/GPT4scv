The provided smart contract code seems to have the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability is present in the fallback function of the Puppet contract. The contract calls an external contract (target[0]) using a low-level call and forwards all of the available gas to the external contract. The external contract could be malicious and call back into the Puppet contract, leading to a reentrancy vulnerability.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses low-level calls (.call.value(_share).gas(800000)()) to send Ether to the addresses stored in the extra mapping, but it doesn't check the return value of these calls. If one of these calls fails for any reason, the contract will not be aware of it. 

3. Denial of Service: If the address in the 'extra' mapping is a contract that always fails or consumes more than 800,000 gas, the 'fundPuppets' function will fail and the Denial of Service condition will occur. 

4. Access Control: The contract uses msg.sender to authenticate the owner in some functions like 'withdraw', 'newPuppet' and 'fundPuppets'. However, the owner is not immutable. If the owner address is compromised, the attacker can get control over these functions.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities:
- Avoid making calls to external contracts when possible or perform such calls at the end of the function to avoid reentrancy.
- Always check the return value of 'call' functions.
- Implement a pull payment system instead of pushing payments directly to external contracts to avoid potential DoS attacks.
- Make the owner address immutable or implement a more secure authentication system.
