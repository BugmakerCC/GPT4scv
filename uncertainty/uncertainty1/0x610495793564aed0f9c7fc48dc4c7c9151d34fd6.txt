The smart contract has several vulnerabilities. Here they are:

1. Reentrancy: The function `withdraw` and `sendMoney` are potentially vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because they call an external contract (with `msg.sender.transfer(_value)` and `_target.call.value(_value)(_data)`) after changing the state. An attacker could create a contract that calls `withdraw` or `sendMoney` function while it is still being executed (i.e., before it finishes and the state is saved), causing funds to be transferred multiple times.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The low level call `_target.call.value(_value)(_data)` does not check the return value. This could allow to silently fail.

3. Denial of Service: If the owner of the contract becomes a contract which throws an exception in its fallback function, then `withdrawAll` and `withdraw` functions will get stuck because `msg.sender.transfer(_value)` will always fail.

4. Access Control: Although this contract seems to correctly implement the `onlyOwner` modifier on critical functions, remember that this only provides protection if the contract owner is secured. If the private key of owner is compromised, the contract will have a vulnerability.

The contract does not seem to have Arithmetic Issues, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, and Short Address Attack vulnerabilities. However, these vulnerabilities should be kept in mind when writing new code or updating the contract.
