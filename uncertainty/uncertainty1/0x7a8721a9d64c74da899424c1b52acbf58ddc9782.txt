The smart contract provided seems to have several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the `CashOut` function. The contract sends Ether to an address with `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` before it reduces the sender's balance. If the fallback function of the sender's address performs a reentrant call to `CashOut`, it could drain more Ether than it has balance in the contract.

2. Access Control: The contract uses `tx.origin` for authorization in the `onlyOwner` modifier. This is a bad practice as it can lead to attacks where a malicious contract tricks the owner into calling a function, allowing the malicious contract to gain owner permissions.

3. Unchecked Return Values: The return value of the `call.value` function is not checked. Although it's checked by an if condition, there's no handling for the case when this call fails.

4. Denial of Service: If the `CashOut` function's `call.value()` fails (for example, if the recipient contract throws an exception), the user's funds can be locked in the contract.

5. Bad Randomness: Not applicable in this contract.

6. Front-Running: Not directly applicable but if a user is expected to call `CashOut` after `Deposit` in a specific period, a miner could front-run the `CashOut` transaction.

7. Time Manipulation: The `Log` contract uses `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) in the `AddMessage` function. This can be manipulated by miners to some degree.

8. Short Address Attack: Not applicable in this contract.

The contract needs to be fixed to prevent these vulnerabilities. The Solidity documentation has recommendations on how to prevent these issues.
