The contract provided has a few vulnerabilities:

1. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses a low-level `.call()` function to interact with another contract, but it does not check the return value of this call. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

2. Reentrancy: While not immediately obvious in this contract, it should be noted that the function `transferFrom` that is being invoked on the contract address could potentially have a reentrancy vulnerability. If the `transferFrom` function is not properly implemented in the contract with the address `contract_address`, it could be exploited by an attacker to drain the contract's funds.

3. Denial of Service: The function `transfer` loops over two arrays (`tos` and `vs`). If these arrays are too large, the function could exceed the gas limit, causing a denial of service.

4. Access Control: The `transfer` function is public and without any checks on who can call it. Anybody can call this function with any `contract_address` and set of addresses (`tos`). This can be a potential security risk depending on the context.

5. Arithmetic Issues: There is no check to prevent overflow or underflow when the function `transfer` is called.

Recommendations:

1. Always check the return value of `.call()` functions and handle failure cases accordingly.
2. Implement checks or use a pattern like Checks-Effects-Interactions to avoid reentrancy attacks.
3. Implement a mechanism to limit the size of the `tos` and `vs` arrays to prevent potential Denial of Service attacks.
4. Implement access control mechanisms to limit who can call sensitive functions in your contract.
5. Use SafeMath or similar libraries to handle arithmetic operations safely.
