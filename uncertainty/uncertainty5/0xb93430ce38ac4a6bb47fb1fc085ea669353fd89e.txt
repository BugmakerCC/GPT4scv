Analyzing the given smart contract, I can identify following potential vulnerabilities:

1. **Reentrancy**: The function `CashOut(uint _am)` allows for a reentrancy attack because it calls an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`) before updating the internal state (`balances[msg.sender]-=_am`). An attacker can recursively call the `CashOut` function before the balance is updated, draining the contract's funds.

2. **Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls**: The contract uses `call.value()()` method in the `CashOut` function without checking its return value. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

3. **Arithmetic Issues**: The contract uses arithmetic operations in the `Deposit` and `CashOut` functions, but there are no safeguards against integer overflows and underflows. This could be a vulnerability if large inputs are used.

4. **Access Control**: The `AddMessage` function in the `Log` contract can be called by anyone since there are no access control mechanisms in place. This could be misused to spam the contract or to manipulate the log messages.

5. **Denial of Service**: The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. If an attacker's contract always throws an exception when receiving Ether, then the `CashOut` function will be stuck because the call to `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` will always fail.

6. **Timestamp Dependence**: The `AddMessage` function in the `Log` contract uses the `now` keyword, which is an alias for `block.timestamp`. Miners have some control over this value, which could potentially be manipulated.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, consider using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, adding overflow/underflow checks using SafeMath library, implementing proper access control, considering pull payments over push payments, and avoiding dependence on block.timestamp.
