The smart contract has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The functions `payout`, `donateToWhale`, and `loseWager` are vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because they call an external contract (`whale`) before the state is finalized. An attacker could recursively call the contract before `totalDonated` is updated or the `Win`, `Donate`, or `Lose` events are emitted.

2. Arithmetic Issues: This contract does not seem to have any integer overflow or underflow issues.

3. Unchecked Return Values: The contract does not check the return value of the `whale.call.value(amount)(bytes4(keccak256("donate()")));` call. If this call fails, the contract will not be aware of it and `totalDonated` will be wrong.

4. Access Control: The contract appears to have solid access control mechanisms in place with the `onlyOwner`, `isOpenToPublic`, `onlyRealPeople`, and `onlyPlayers` modifiers. However, the use of `onlyRealPeople` could potentially block contracts from interacting with this contract.

5. Denial of Service: In the `payout` function, if the `winner` is a contract that throws an exception in its fallback function, the `payout` function will be locked, causing a denial of service.

6. Bad Randomness: The `play` function's use of `blockhash` for randomness could potentially be manipulated by miners.

7. Front-Running: The contract could be vulnerable to front-running as attackers could see the transaction in the mempool before it's mined and place a bet with a higher gas price to get it mined first.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses `block.number` as a timestamp, which can be manipulated by miners to a certain degree.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack as it does not take address lengths from user input. 

10. The contract allows the owner to transfer any ERC20 token sent to the contract. If the owner is a malicious actor, this could lead to loss of tokens.

Please note these are potential vulnerabilities and their exploitation would depend on various factors like user behavior, miner behavior, and blockchain state.
