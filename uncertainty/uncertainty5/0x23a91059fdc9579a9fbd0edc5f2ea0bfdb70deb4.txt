The smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it calls an external contract (with `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`) before it updates the state (`balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`). An attacker can make a recursive call to drain the contract.

2. Access Control: There is no restriction on who can call the `AddMessage` function in the `Log` contract. An attacker can call this function to put misleading information in the log.

3. Arithmetic Issues: This contract doesn't have any arithmetic issues such as integer overflow and underflow because it doesn't have any arithmetic operations that could potentially overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The return value of the low level call `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` isn't checked. If this call fails, the contract won't be aware and will continue to execute.

5. Denial of Service: An attacker could potentially make the fallback function run out of gas by sending lots of Ether to it, but this seems unlikely because it doesn't do anything complex.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract doesn't use randomness, so it's not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: This contract isn't vulnerable to front-running because it doesn't have transaction ordering dependence.

8. Time Manipulation: The `Log` contract does depend on timestamps (with `LastMsg.Time = now;`), so it may be vulnerable to miner manipulation of timestamps.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack because it doesn't use `msg.data.length` or similar.
