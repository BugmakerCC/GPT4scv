The following vulnerabilities can be detected in this smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The reentrancy vulnerability exists in the `redeem` and `withdraw` functions where the `transfer` method is called. If the caller of these functions is a contract, it can recursively call these functions, draining the contract's Ether.

2. Access Control: The `Command` function is vulnerable as it allows the `Owner` to execute arbitrary calls with arbitrary data on any address. This can be exploited to change contract state in unexpected ways.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There aren't any arithmetic operations in the contract, therefore no arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `call` method in the `Command` function does not check its return value, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

5. Denial of Service: In `redeem` and `withdraw` functions, if the `Owner` is a contract and its fallback function reverts or runs out of gas, it can cause a denial-of-service attack by blocking Ether withdrawal.

6. Bad Randomness: There is no use of randomness in the contract, so no bad randomness issues.

7. Front Running: There is no transaction ordering dependency, so no front-running issues.

8. Time Manipulation: This contract doesn't rely on timestamps or block numbers, so no time manipulation issues.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not take any token transfer so there's no short address attack.

Please note that the review of the contract is not exhaustive and there might be other security considerations not covered in this analysis.
