The given smart contract contains several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it first sends ether with `_addr.call.value(_wei)` and then decreases the sender's balance. An attacker can re-enter the function before the user's balance is decreased.

2. Access Control: The `onlyOwner` modifier is supposed to restrict access to the owner only, but it's not working correctly. The reason is that the `if(owner == msg.sender)_;` statement does nothing. It should throw an exception if `msg.sender` is not the owner, like this `require(owner == msg.sender);`

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not handle potential overflows or underflows in the `Deposit` and `WithdrawToHolder` functions. SafeMath library should be used to prevent these issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The low level `.call()` function is used in `WithdrawToken` and `WithdrawToHolder`. The return value of the `call()` function is not checked, which can lead to silent failing of the function.

5. Denial of Service: The `changeOwner` function can be abused by the current owner to stop the contract from functioning by setting the `newOwner` to an address that will never call `confirmOwner()`.

6. Bad randomness: Not applicable, as this contract does not involve randomness.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable, as this contract does not involve transaction ordering.

8. Time manipulation: Not applicable, as this contract does not depend on timestamps.

9. Short Address Attack: Not directly applicable, but the contract does not validate the length of the address inputs, which can lead to unforeseen consequences.

Please note that these are potential vulnerabilities and actual impact may vary based on the contract's use case and environment. It's always recommended to have a thorough security audit before deploying the contract on mainnet.
