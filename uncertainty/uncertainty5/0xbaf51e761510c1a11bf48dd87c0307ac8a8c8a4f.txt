The smart contract provided seems to contain the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the CashOut function. The contract first sends Ether with `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` and then reduces the balance of the sender with `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`. An attacker can recursively call the CashOut function before the balance is reduced, draining the contract funds.

2. Arithmetic Issues: In the Deposit function, the contract uses the `+=` operator without checking for an overflow. This can potentially lead to an integer overflow vulnerability.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses `call.value()` without checking the return value. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

4. Denial of Service: If an attacker's fallback function always fails, it can prevent the legitimate owner from withdrawing their funds, leading to a denial of service.

5. Access Control: The AddMessage function in the Log contract can be called by anyone, this might lead to incorrect logging if an attacker decides to send misleading messages.

The other mentioned vulnerabilities (Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, Short Address Attack) do not appear to be present in this contract. However, without information on how the contract is used, it's impossible to say for sure. For instance, if the ordering of transactions is important or if there's an off-chain component, Front-Running or Short Address Attack might be possible, respectively.
