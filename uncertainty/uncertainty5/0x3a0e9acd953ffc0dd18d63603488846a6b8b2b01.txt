Analyzing the smart contract, we can detect the following potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract may be vulnerable to reentrancy in the `WithdrawToHolder` function. The function sends Ether to an address before decrementing the balance of that address (`Holders[_addr]-=_wei;`). If the callee is a contract, it could call `WithdrawToHolder` again before the balance is updated, extracting more Ether than it should.

2. Access Control: The contract uses a simple access control mechanism, only allowing the `owner` to call certain functions. However, the `onlyOwner` modifier doesn't actually stop the execution of the function if the caller is not the owner, it just checks the condition and continues. This means any address can call `onlyOwner` functions. This is a critical vulnerability.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no obvious arithmetic issues like integer overflow or underflow in the contract.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses low-level function `.call()`, but does not check the return value. This is a vulnerability because if a `.call()` fails, the contract will continue executing normally.

5. Denial Of Service: There is a potential for denial of service in the `changeOwner` function. If an attacker sets the `newOwner` to a contract that throws on its fallback function, `confirmOwner` will become unusable.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no apparent issues related to randomness.

7. Front-Running: There are no apparent issues related to front-running.

8. Time Manipulation: There are no apparent issues related to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract doesnâ€™t seem vulnerable to Short Address Attack as it doesn't rely on `msg.data.length` for validation or assumes the length of the input. 

This analysis is based on the provided code and the mentioned vulnerabilities. Actual vulnerabilities may vary depending on the contract's use case, additional code, and the environment in which it's used.
