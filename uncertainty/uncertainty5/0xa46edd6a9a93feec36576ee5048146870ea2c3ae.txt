The contract you provided has several vulnerabilities. Here's the breakdown:

1. Reentrancy: This contract is potentially vulnerable to reentrancy. It is making calls to external contracts (caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v[i]);) which makes it susceptible to reentrancy attacks. An attacker could make the external contract call back into the EBU contract before the first invocation is completed.

2. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism in place. Any user can call the `transfer` function. This could allow malicious actions by unauthorized users.

3. Arithmetic Issues: While this contract doesn't perform any arithmetic operations, it's worth noting that without proper checks, underflows and overflows could be a significant issue.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses low-level .call invocation which returns false in case of execution failure. Yet, it does not check the return value of the call, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

5. Denial of Service: While not directly apparent in this contract, by making the function call external contracts, it could potentially become a victim of a Denial of Service attack if the external contract is coded to fail or consume a lot of gas.

6. Bad Randomness: This contract doesn't use randomness so this vulnerability doesn't apply.

7. Front-Running: This contract doesn't perform any operations related to transaction ordering, so it's not vulnerable to front-running.

8. Time manipulation: This contract doesn't rely on block timestamps so this vulnerability doesn't apply.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract doesn't check the length of the addresses that are passed as arguments. This opens up the possibility of a short address attack.

In order to fix these issues, the contract should have proper access control, check the return value of the .call invocation, limit the gas for the external call, and check the length of the address arguments.
