The smart contract provided has several vulnerabilities:

1. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses the low-level `call` function without checking its return value. If any of the `call` operations fail, the contract will silently continue its execution, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

2. Reentrancy: The `transfer` function transfers tokens to multiple addresses within a loop. If one of the recipient addresses is a contract that implements a fallback function, it might be possible for that contract to call `transfer` again before the original call has completed, leading to a potential reentrancy attack.

3. Denial of Service: In the `transfer` function, the loop iterates over the `_tos` array. If this array is of significant length, the function could reach the gas limit and fail, potentially blocking further transactions.

4. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism in the contract. This means any address can call the `transfer` function and potentially drain assets if they have the right `from` address.

5. Arithmetic Issues: This issue doesn't appear in the contract since no arithmetic operations are performed. However, it's always important to use safe math to avoid overflows or underflows.

6. Bad randomness, Front-Running, Time Manipulation, and Short Address Attack are not directly applicable to this contract. 

Recommendations to mitigate these vulnerabilities:

1. Always check the return value of a `call` function and handle potential failure.
2. Use a reentrancy guard to prevent reentrant calls.
3. Implement some form of access control to restrict who can call sensitive functions.
4. Limit the size of the `_tos` array to ensure the `transfer` function doesn't exceed the gas limit.
5. Use safe math libraries for arithmetic operations.
