The smart contract provided has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `Collect(uint _am)` is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. This is due to the fact that the contract calls an external contract (via `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`) before it reduces the balance of the caller (via `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`). An attacker can make a recursive call back into the `Collect` function to drain more Ether than they should be able to.

2. Access Control: There is no restriction on who can call the `SetMinSum(uint _val)` and `SetLogFile(address _log)` functions. Any user can call these functions and potentially disrupt the normal operation of the contract.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The return value of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `Collect(uint _am)` function is not checked. If this call fails for any reason, the contract will continue execution and can potentially get into an incorrect state.

4. Denial of Service: If an attacker's contract is called through `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` and the attacker's contract always throws an exception, the `Collect(uint _am)` function will get stuck and no one will be able to withdraw their balance.

5. Bad Randomness: This contract does not contain any randomness, so this vulnerability is not present.

6. Front-Running: This contract does not have any transaction ordering dependencies, so this vulnerability is not present.

7. Time manipulation: This contract does not rely on block timestamps (`now`), so this vulnerability is not present.

8. Short Address Attack: As the contract does not take input directly from the user (besides Ether value), it is not susceptible to a short address attack.

To fix these vulnerabilities, consider implementing a withdrawal pattern for `Collect(uint _am)` to avoid reentrancy, add proper access control to administrative functions, check the return value of the `call` function, and avoid the use of the `call` function to prevent the DoS attack.
