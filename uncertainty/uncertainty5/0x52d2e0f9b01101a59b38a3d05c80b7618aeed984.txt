This smart contract has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `withdrawEther` is vulnerable to reentrancy. An attacker might recursively call the `withdrawEther` function before the first invocation of the function has finished. This could allow an attacker to drain the contract's Ether balance.

2. Access Control: The `withdrawTokens` and `withdrawEther` functions are public and can be invoked by anyone. The contract does not have any access control mechanisms to restrict who can call these functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: This smart contract does not seem to have any arithmetic operations, so it is not vulnerable to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values: The `transfer` function in `withdrawTokens` does not check the return value. If the transfer fails for some reason, the contract will not be aware of it.

5. Denial of Service: The `getTokens` function could potentially be used for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. If `num` is a large number, it could consume all the gas in a block and prevent other transactions from being processed.

6. Bad Randomness: This smart contract does not use any random number generation, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not appear to be vulnerable to front-running, as it does not depend on transaction ordering.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on block timestamps, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack as it does not directly interact with user-supplied addresses. However, the `getTokens` method could potentially be abused if a short address is supplied.

To rectify these issues, consider adding access control mechanisms, such as the OpenZeppelin's Ownable pattern, to restrict who can call certain functions. Also, ensure to handle possible failures of the `transfer` function, and consider adding a limit to the `num` parameter in the `getTokens` function to prevent possible DoS attacks.
