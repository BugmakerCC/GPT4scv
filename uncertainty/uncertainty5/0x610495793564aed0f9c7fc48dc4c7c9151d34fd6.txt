This smart contract contains several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdraw(uint _value)` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The contract sends Ether with `msg.sender.transfer(_value)`. If `msg.sender` is a malicious contract, it could re-enter the `withdraw` function before the first invocation of the function has finished.

2. Access Control: The contract looks good in terms of access control. The `onlyOwner` modifier is applied to sensitive operations, and the modifier correctly checks that `msg.sender == owner`.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in this contract, so it's not vulnerable to underflows or overflows.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The function `sendMoney(address _target, uint _value, bytes _data)` contains a low-level call (`_target.call.value(_value)(_data)`) without checking its return value. If the call fails, the contract will not be aware of it.

5. Denial of Service: There are no loops in the contract and gas usage seems to be under control, so it's unlikely to be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

6. Bad Randomness: There is no randomness in the contract, so it's not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: No transaction ordering dependence or race conditions in the contract.

8. Time manipulation: There is no reliance on block timestamps, so no timestamp dependence.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to short address attacks as it doesn't manipulate the address inputs. 

The main issues here are the reentrancy attack and the unchecked return values for low-level calls.
