This smart contract has several vulnerabilities according to the list provided. They are:

1. Reentrancy: The function `Collect()` is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it makes an external call to an unknown address using `call.value()`, and state changes happen after this call. This means that the called contract could call back into `Collect()` before the state (in this case `balances[msg.sender]`) has been updated.

2. Arithmetic issues: While there are no obvious overflows or underflows in this contract, Solidity prior to version 0.8.0 does not automatically handle these, so they could potentially occur.

3. Unchecked return values: The contract does not check the return value of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in `Collect()`. If this call fails for any reason, the contract will not be aware of this and will continue execution.

4. Denial of Service: If an attacker manages to cause the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` call in `Collect()` to always fail (for example by causing it to always run out of gas), they could prevent the rightful owner of the funds from withdrawing them.

5. Access Control: The contract has some functions that can only be called once (`SetMinSum()`, `SetLogFile()`, and `Initialized()`). However, anyone can call these functions, not just the contract owner. This means that anyone could potentially maliciously call these functions to disrupt the contract's operation.

6. Bad randomness: Not applicable, as the contract does not use randomness.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable, as this contract does not have transactions that depend on the order of execution.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses `now` in the `AddMessage` function of the `LogFile` contract, which could potentially be manipulated by miners.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable, as the contract does not take any address inputs. 

In summary, this contract is vulnerable to reentrancy, arithmetic issues, unchecked return values, DoS, access control, and time manipulation vulnerabilities.
