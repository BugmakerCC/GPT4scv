This smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. In the 'CashOut' function, the contract sends ether with 'msg.sender.call.value(_am)()' before updating its state 'balances[msg.sender]-=_am'. This order allows an attacker to re-enter the contract before it's state is updated.

2. Access Control: The 'AddMessage' function in the 'Log' contract is public, which means anyone can call this function, not only the 'Private_Bank' contract. This can lead to incorrect logs.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: Although the return value of 'msg.sender.call.value(_am)()' is checked, the return value of 'History.push(LastMsg)' in the 'AddMessage' function is not checked. If the 'push' operation fails, the contract will not be aware of this.

4. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not have any safeguards against integer overflow or underflow. Although not currently exploitable in this contract, good practice is to use SafeMath library for arithmetic operations to prevent future vulnerabilities.

The contract doesn't seem to have vulnerabilities related to Denial of Service, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, and Short Address Attack. However, the contract can be improved by adding more checks and balances, using modifiers to restrict access to certain functions, and following best practices for solidity coding.
