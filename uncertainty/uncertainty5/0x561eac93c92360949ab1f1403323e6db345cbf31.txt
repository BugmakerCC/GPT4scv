The contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The Collect function makes an external call to msg.sender.call.value(_am)() before it reduces the sender's balance. This means that the external account can call Collect again before the first call has finished, and potentially withdraw more Ether than they have in their balance. This is a classic reentrancy vulnerability. 

2. Access Control: The functions SetMinSum, SetLogFile and Initialized can be called by anyone. There is no access control mechanism in place to restrict who can call these functions. 

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The low-level call in Collect does not check its return value. If the call fails, the contract will not be aware of this. 

4. Denial of Service: An attacker could potentially make the contract run out of gas by making it execute an infinite loop or a very large number of operations. 

5. Arithmetic Issues: There is a risk of underflow when the balance is updated in the Collect function. If the balance is less than _am, subtracting _am from the balance will result in a very large number due to underflow. 

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable as the contract does not involve any randomness.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable as the contract does not involve any transaction ordering dependence or race conditions.

8. Time Manipulation: Not applicable as the contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical functionalities.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable as the contract does not take addresses as inputs. 

Overall, the contract needs to implement proper access control, check the return value of the low-level call in Collect, prevent reentrancy in Collect and guard against underflows in arithmetic operations.
