Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the vulnerabilities mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external function calls, so it is not susceptible to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract has an "onlyOwner" modifier that restricts certain functions to be called only by the owner of the contract. This provides basic access control.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract, so there is no risk of integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls, so there is no need to check return values.

5. Denial of Service: There are no gas limit reached, unexpected throw, unexpected kill, or access control breach vulnerabilities in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness, so there is no concern for bad randomness vulnerabilities.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not involve any time-dependent operations or race conditions, so there is no front-running vulnerability.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical functionality, so there is no time manipulation vulnerability.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not involve any off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities, so there is no short address attack vulnerability.

Overall, the contract appears to be relatively secure and does not exhibit any of the mentioned vulnerabilities. However, it is always recommended to perform a thorough security audit to ensure all aspects of the contract are secure.
