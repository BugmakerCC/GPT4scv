The provided smart contract does not contain any of the mentioned vulnerabilities. Here is a breakdown of the vulnerabilities and their absence in the contract:

1. Reentrancy: There are no external function calls made within loops or recursion, so there is no reentrancy vulnerability.
2. Access Control: The contract uses the `onlyowner` modifier to restrict certain functions to be called only by the contract creator.
3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could result in integer overflow or underflow.
4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls to external contracts.
5. Denial of Service: There are no gas limit-related issues or unexpected throw or kill statements in the contract.
6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any random number generation.
7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any race conditions or transaction ordering dependence.
8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical functionality.
9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the provided smart contract seems to be free from the mentioned vulnerabilities. However, it's important to note that this assessment is based on a static analysis of the code and does not guarantee the absence of other potential vulnerabilities. A thorough security audit is always recommended before deploying any smart contract to a production environment.
