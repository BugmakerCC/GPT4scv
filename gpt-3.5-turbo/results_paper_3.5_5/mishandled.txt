The provided smart contract is susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities. Let's go through each of the mentioned vulnerabilities and check if the contract is affected by them:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not contain any external function calls that could potentially lead to reentrancy attacks. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to this issue.

2. Access Control: There is no explicit access control mechanism implemented in the contract. This means that anyone can call the `withdrawBalance` function and potentially withdraw funds from any user's balance. This is a major vulnerability.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations, so it is not vulnerable to arithmetic issues like integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses the `send` function to transfer funds to the user. The `send` function returns a boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful or not. However, the return value is not checked in the contract, which is a vulnerability. If the `send` call fails, the user's balance will still be set to 0, but they will not receive their funds.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit denial of service vulnerabilities.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness, so it is not susceptible to bad randomness vulnerabilities.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any specific vulnerabilities related to front-running or transaction ordering.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical functionality, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not involve any off-chain or client-related operations, so it is not affected by short address attacks.

In summary, the provided contract is vulnerable to access control issues and the unchecked return values for low-level calls. It is recommended to implement an access control mechanism and handle the return value of the `send` function to ensure that funds are transferred correctly.
