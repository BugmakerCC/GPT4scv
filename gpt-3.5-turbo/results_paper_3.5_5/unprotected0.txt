Based on the provided smart contract, here is an analysis of the vulnerabilities mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls or interactions, so there is no risk of reentrancy in this contract.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the "onlyowner" modifier to restrict access to the "changeOwner" function. Only the contract owner can call this function.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract, so there is no risk of integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls, so there is no risk of unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: There are no gas limit related issues or unexpected throw or kill in the contract. Access control is properly implemented.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness, so there is no risk of bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: There are no transaction ordering dependencies or race conditions in the contract.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps, so there is no risk of time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not involve any off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the provided smart contract does not exhibit any of the mentioned vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that this analysis is specific to the given code and does not take into account any potential vulnerabilities in the dependencies or external contracts that this contract may rely on.
