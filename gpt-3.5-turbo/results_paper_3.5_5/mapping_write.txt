Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities identified:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external function calls or transfers that could potentially allow reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract lacks any access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the `set` and `get` functions. This could lead to unauthorized modifications of the mapping.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract that could result in integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `withdraw` function uses the `transfer` method, which automatically throws an exception if the transfer fails. However, there is no mechanism to handle the exception or check the return value.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not exhibit any denial of service vulnerabilities.

6. Bad Randomness: There is no randomness or reliance on external sources of randomness in the contract.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not involve any transactions that could be susceptible to front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps or time-sensitive operations, so time manipulation vulnerabilities are not present.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not contain any off-chain interactions or user input that could be exploited by a short address attack.

To summarize, the vulnerabilities identified in the provided smart contract are the lack of access control and the absence of proper handling for the return value of the `transfer` function.
