Here is an analysis of the provided smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls to other contracts, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the "Owner" variable to restrict certain functions, but it does not have a proper access control mechanism. Anyone can call the "withdraw" and "Command" functions as long as they match the condition in the "withdraw" function. This makes the contract vulnerable to unauthorized access.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations, so it is not vulnerable to arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses a low-level call in the "Command" function, but it does not check the return value. This can lead to silent failures if the called contract reverts or throws an exception.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any specific vulnerabilities related to denial of service.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any specific vulnerabilities related to front-running.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical operations, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any specific vulnerabilities related to off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract is vulnerable to access control issues and unchecked return values for low-level calls. It is recommended to implement a proper access control mechanism and check the return values of low-level calls to improve the security of the contract.
