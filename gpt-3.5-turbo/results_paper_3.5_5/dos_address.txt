Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities it exhibits:

1. Denial of Service (DoS): The `emptyCreditors` function can potentially cause a DoS attack by resetting the `creditorAddresses` array when it exceeds a length of 1500. This could consume a significant amount of gas and potentially cause the contract to run out of gas, preventing other functionalities from executing.

2. Gas Limit Reached: Similar to the DoS vulnerability, the `addCreditors` function can lead to a gas limit reached scenario. This function iteratively adds `msg.sender` to the `creditorAddresses` array, potentially causing the contract to run out of gas when the array length exceeds a certain limit.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, consider implementing a more efficient mechanism for managing `creditorAddresses` or limiting the number of creditors that can be added.

Please note that this analysis does not cover all possible vulnerabilities, and it is essential to conduct a comprehensive security audit before deploying any smart contract to a production environment.
