The provided smart contract appears to contain the Unchecked Return Values vulnerability.

In the `callchecked` function, the `require` statement is used to check the return value of the `call` function. If the `call` function fails, the `require` statement will revert the transaction, preventing any further execution. This is a good practice to handle potential failures.

On the other hand, in the `callnotchecked` function, the return value of the `call` function is not checked. This means that if the `call` function fails, the execution will continue without any error handling. This can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

To fix this vulnerability, you should always check the return value of low-level calls like `call` or `delegatecall`.
