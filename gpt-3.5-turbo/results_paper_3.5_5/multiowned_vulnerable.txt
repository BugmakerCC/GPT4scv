Here is the analysis of the smart contract for the vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract seems to be safe from reentrancy attacks as there are no external calls made within the contract's functions.

2. Access Control: The contract implements access control using the `onlyOwner` modifier, which restricts certain functions to be called only by the owner.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract that could lead to overflow or underflow issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls, so there is no risk of unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: There are no gas limit reached vulnerabilities, unexpected throws, or unexpected kills in the contract. Access control is properly implemented, which prevents unauthorized actions.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any randomness-related functionalities, so this vulnerability does not apply.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any time-of-check vs time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities or transaction ordering dependence issues.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical operations, so time manipulation is not a concern.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the smart contract does not seem to have any of the mentioned vulnerabilities. However, it is always recommended to conduct a thorough security audit to ensure the contract's safety.
