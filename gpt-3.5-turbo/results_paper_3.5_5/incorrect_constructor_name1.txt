Upon analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities identified:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls, so there is no risk of reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract has a basic access control mechanism implemented using the `onlyowner` modifier. Only the `owner` can call the `withdraw` function.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations performed in the contract, so there is no risk of integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values: There are no low-level calls in the contract that require checking return values, so this vulnerability is not present.

5. Denial of Service: There are no gas limit-related issues, unexpected throw or kill, or access control breaches in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness, so this vulnerability is not applicable.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any time-of-check vs time-of-use (TOCTOU) or transaction ordering dependence (TOD) issues.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not depend on timestamps, so this vulnerability is not present.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not involve any off-chain interactions, so this vulnerability is not applicable.

In conclusion, the provided smart contract does not have any of the mentioned vulnerabilities.
