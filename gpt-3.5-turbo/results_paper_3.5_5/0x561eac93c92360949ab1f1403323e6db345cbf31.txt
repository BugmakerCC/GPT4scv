Based on the provided smart contract, here is an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not contain any explicit calls to external contracts or calls within loops, so it does not appear to have a reentrancy vulnerability.

2. Access Control: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the functions and modify the balances. This can be considered a vulnerability if only certain authorized parties should be able to interact with the contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic calculations in the contract, so there is no direct vulnerability related to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does make a low-level call to `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`, but it does not check the return value to handle any failure cases. This can lead to silent failures if the call to the recipient address fails or reverts.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any specific mechanisms to prevent denial of service attacks, such as limiting gas usage or implementing rate limiting.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no random number generation functions in the contract, so it does not have a direct vulnerability related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any critical operations that can be front-run, so it does not appear to be vulnerable to front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on the timestamp for any critical operations, so it does not have a direct vulnerability related to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities, so it does not have a direct vulnerability related to short address attacks.

Overall, the contract may have vulnerabilities related to access control and unchecked return values for low-level calls. It is recommended to implement access control mechanisms and handle the return values of low-level calls to ensure the contract's security.
