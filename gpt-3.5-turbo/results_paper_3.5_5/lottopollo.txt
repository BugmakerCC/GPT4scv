Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, I have identified the following vulnerabilities:

1. Time Manipulation: The contract uses the `now` keyword to calculate the difference between the current time and the `rand` value. However, the `now` keyword can be manipulated by miners to potentially exploit the contract. This vulnerability is found in the `payOut` function (lines 9-16) and the `randomGen` function (lines 18-21). To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a more secure source of time, such as a trusted oracle.

Please note that while I have identified one vulnerability, there may be other vulnerabilities present in the contract that require further analysis. It is always recommended to conduct a thorough security audit to ensure the contract is free from any vulnerabilities.
