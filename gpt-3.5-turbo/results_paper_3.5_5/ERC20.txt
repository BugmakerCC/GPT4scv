The provided smart contract does not contain any of the nine common vulnerabilities you mentioned. Here is an analysis of the contract:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls that can be exploited for reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms, but it is intentional as it implements a basic ERC20 token functionality.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The SafeMath library is used for all arithmetic operations, which protects against integer overflow and underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls (e.g., call, delegatecall, or callcode) that require checking return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any functionalities that can be exploited for denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness generation, so there is no vulnerability related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any functionalities that can be exploited for front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical functionalities, so there is no vulnerability related to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any functionalities that can be exploited for short address attacks.

Overall, the provided smart contract is well-written and does not contain any of the mentioned vulnerabilities.
