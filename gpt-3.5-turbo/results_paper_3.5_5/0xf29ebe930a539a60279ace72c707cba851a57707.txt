I will analyze the smart contract to check for the mentioned vulnerabilities.

1. Reentrancy: 
The go() function makes a call to the target contract before transferring the balance to the owner. This could potentially allow the target contract to call back into the B contract and execute the go() function again before the balance transfer, leading to a reentrancy vulnerability.

2. Access Control:
There is no explicit access control mechanism in the contract. The owner variable is set to the sender of the contract deployment, but it doesn't provide any access control functionality.

3. Arithmetic Issues:
There are no arithmetic operations in the contract, so there are no direct arithmetic vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls:
The target.call.value(msg.value)() function doesn't check the return value of the call. This can lead to silent failures if the target contract reverts or fails to execute properly.

5. Denial of Service:
There are no explicit denial of service vulnerabilities in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness:
There are no random number generation or secret handling operations in the contract, so there are no direct vulnerabilities related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running:
There are no specific vulnerabilities related to transaction ordering or race conditions.

8. Time Manipulation:
There are no explicit timestamp dependencies in the contract, so there are no direct vulnerabilities related to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack:
There are no off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities in the contract.

Overall, the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy and unchecked return values for low-level calls. Access control and other mentioned vulnerabilities are not present in this contract.
