Upon analyzing the provided smart contract, I have identified several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks. After the balance is updated, the contract calls the `msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)()` function, which allows an external contract to call back into the `withdrawFunds` function before the balance is deducted. This can lead to multiple withdrawals and potential loss of funds.

2. Access Control: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms. Any user can deposit and withdraw funds, potentially leading to unauthorized access and misuse of funds.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not include any checks for integer overflow or underflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not check the return value of the `call.value()` function. This can result in silent failures if the call fails, allowing an attacker to bypass the withdrawal limit and withdrawal restrictions.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not impose any gas limits on the execution of its functions. This can lead to denial of service attacks by consuming excessive gas and preventing other transactions from being processed.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not include any mechanisms for generating random numbers. This can be exploited by attackers to manipulate outcomes based on predictable or known values.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not include any protections against front-running attacks. An attacker can monitor pending transactions and manipulate the order of execution to their advantage, potentially causing undesired results.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract relies on the `now` variable for time-based restrictions. However, the `now` variable can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to bypass time-based checks.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not include checks for the length of the `msg.data` field, making it vulnerable to short address attacks.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the contract should be modified to address each of the identified issues.
