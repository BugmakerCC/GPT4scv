Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not call any external contracts or use any delegate calls, so there is no direct risk of reentrancy vulnerability.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any explicit access control mechanisms. Anyone can call the Deposit and CashOut functions, which may lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of balances.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic calculations in the contract, so there is no direct risk of integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The contract uses the call function without checking the return value. This can lead to silent failures if the external contract called by msg.sender.call.value(_am)() throws an exception or reverts. It is recommended to check the return value of the call function and handle failures appropriately.

5. Denial of Service: There is no specific vulnerability related to gas limit reached or unexpected throw. However, the lack of access control in the CashOut function allows an attacker to drain the contract's balance, causing a denial of service for other users.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any random number generation, so there is no direct risk of bad randomness vulnerability.

7. Front-Running: There are no explicit race conditions or time-of-check vs time-of-use vulnerabilities in the contract.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical operations, so there is no direct risk of time manipulation vulnerability.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not involve any off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities, so there is no direct risk of a short address attack.

Overall, the contract has vulnerabilities related to access control and unchecked return values for low-level calls. It is recommended to implement proper access control mechanisms and handle return values of external calls to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
