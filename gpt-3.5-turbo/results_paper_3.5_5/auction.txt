After carefully analyzing the smart contract provided, I have identified several vulnerabilities:

1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack: This vulnerability can be exploited by a frontrunner who always fails to receive a refund. This would result in the frontrunner winning the auction by preventing other participants from outbidding them.

2. Access Control: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the `bid` function and potentially disrupt the auction process.

To address these vulnerabilities, the following changes can be made to the contract:

1. Implement Access Control: Add a modifier or function to restrict the `bid` function to only be callable by authorized participants.

2. Mitigate DoS Attack: Instead of using the `send` function, use the `transfer` function to send the refund to the frontrunner. This ensures that if the refund fails, the transaction will revert, preventing a frontrunner who always fails from winning.

Here is the updated smart contract with the mentioned changes:

pragma solidity ^0.4.15;

//Auction with improved security
contract SecureAuction {
  address currentFrontrunner;
  uint currentBid;

  // Modifier to restrict access to authorized participants
  modifier onlyAuthorized {
    require(msg.sender == authorizedAddress);
    _;
  }

  // Authorized address for accessing bid function
  address authorizedAddress;

  // Set the authorized address during contract deployment
  function SecureAuction() {
    authorizedAddress = msg.sender;
  }

  // Takes in bid, refunding the frontrunner if they are outbid
  function bid() payable onlyAuthorized {
    require(msg.value > currentBid);

    // If the refund fails, the entire transaction reverts.
    // Therefore, a frontrunner who always fails will not win.
    if (currentFrontrunner != 0) {
      // E.g., if recipients fallback function is just revert()
      currentFrontrunner.transfer(currentBid);
    }

    currentFrontrunner = msg.sender;
    currentBid = msg.value;
  }
}

Please note that these changes address the mentioned vulnerabilities, but it is always recommended to review and test the contract thoroughly to ensure its security.
