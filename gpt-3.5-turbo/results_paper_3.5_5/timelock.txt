Here is the analysis of the provided smart contract for the vulnerabilities mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy as there are no external contract calls within the `withdraw` function.

2. Access Control: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms. This means that anyone can deposit, increase lock time, and withdraw funds. It is recommended to add access control checks to restrict certain functions to specific roles or addresses.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not use any low-level calls (`call`, `delegatecall`, `callcode`) that require checking return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit gas limit checks. However, the `withdraw` function has a requirement that the lock time must be expired before funds can be withdrawn. If an attacker were to repeatedly call the `increaseLockTime` function, they could potentially lock up the funds indefinitely, causing a denial-of-service situation.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not rely on any randomness sources, so this vulnerability is not applicable.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not contain any sensitive operations that can be front-run.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses the `now` keyword to set the lock time and check if it has expired. However, this is susceptible to manipulation by miners. It is recommended to use a more robust time source such as block timestamps.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not perform any external calls that could be vulnerable to a short address attack.

Overall, the contract does not have any severe vulnerabilities. However, it lacks access control and uses `now` for time-based operations, which can be improved for better security.
