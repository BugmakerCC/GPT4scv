Upon analyzing the provided smart contract, I have identified the following vulnerabilities:

1. Arithmetic Issues (Integer Overflow): The `add` function in the contract does not check for potential overflow when adding the `deposit` value to the `balance`. If the value of `deposit` is large enough, it could cause an integer overflow, resulting in an unexpected and incorrect balance.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you can implement checks to ensure that the addition does not result in an overflow. One possible approach is to use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations.

Here's an updated version of the contract that addresses this vulnerability:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.4.25;

import "./SafeMath.sol";

contract Overflow_Add {
    using SafeMath for uint256;
    uint public balance = 1;

    function add(uint256 deposit) public {
        balance = balance.add(deposit);
    }
}
```

2. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The `add` function does not handle the return value of the `add` operation. This can lead to silent failures if the `add` operation fails for any reason.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should check the return value of the `add` operation and handle any potential errors appropriately.
