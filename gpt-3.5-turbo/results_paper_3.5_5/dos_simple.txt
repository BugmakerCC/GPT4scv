The smart contract provided does not contain any of the nine common vulnerabilities mentioned. Here is the analysis of the contract:

1. Reentrancy: There are no external contract calls or recursive calls within the `ifillArray` function, so reentrancy vulnerability is not present.

2. Access Control: There are no explicit access control mechanisms implemented in the contract. It is accessible to anyone who calls the `ifillArray` function. Depending on the intended use case, this may or may not be considered a vulnerability.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract, so integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities are not present.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: There are no low-level calls (`call`, `delegatecall`, `send`, etc.) in the contract, so this vulnerability is not applicable.

5. Denial of Service: There are no gas limit-related vulnerabilities or unexpected throws in the contract. Access control is also not breached. Therefore, denial of service vulnerabilities are not present.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness, so this vulnerability is not applicable.

7. Front-Running: There are no sensitive operations or race conditions in the contract that can be exploited by front-running attacks. Therefore, this vulnerability is not present.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical operations, so time manipulation vulnerabilities are not present.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not interact with external contracts or use low-level calls, so short address attack vulnerabilities are not applicable.

Overall, the provided smart contract does not exhibit any of the mentioned vulnerabilities.
