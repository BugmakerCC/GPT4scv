The provided smart contract is susceptible to the following vulnerabilities:

1. Integer Overflow: The function `transfer` does not check for integer overflow when updating the balances of the sender and receiver. If the addition of `_value` to `balanceOf[_to]` exceeds the maximum value for a uint256, it will wrap around to zero, resulting in an incorrect balance.

2. Access Control: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms. Anyone can call the `transfer` function and modify the balances of any address.

To fix these vulnerabilities, you can modify the contract as follows:

pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract IntegerOverflowAdd {
    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf;

    // Secure transfer function
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");
        require(balanceOf[_to] + _value >= balanceOf[_to], "Integer overflow");

        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
        balanceOf[_to] += _value;
    }
}

In the updated contract:
- The addition of `_value` to `balanceOf[_to]` is checked to ensure it does not result in an integer overflow.
- The `require` statement is used to check if the sender has a sufficient balance before performing the transfer.
- Access control mechanisms can be added as per the specific requirements of the contract.
