The smart contract provided does not contain any of the nine common vulnerabilities mentioned. Here is the analysis of the contract:

1. Reentrancy: There are no external calls or transfer of funds in the contract, so the reentrancy vulnerability is not present.

2. Access Control: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, so it is vulnerable to unauthorized access.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The SafeMath library is used for arithmetic operations, which prevents integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: There are no low-level calls in the contract, so this vulnerability is not present.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit reached, unexpected throw, unexpected kill, or access control breaches that could lead to a denial of service.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not include any random number generation, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not include any critical operations that could be front-run by attackers.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical operations, so time manipulation is not a vulnerability.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the provided smart contract is well-written and does not contain any of the common vulnerabilities mentioned. However, it is important to note that vulnerabilities can also exist in the contract's business logic, which cannot be detected by a static analysis of the code.
