Upon analyzing the given smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability occurs when an external contract can call back into the vulnerable contract before the first call completes. In the `CashOut` function, the balance of the sender is updated after the external call to `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`, creating a potential reentrancy vulnerability. To fix this, the balance should be updated before making the external call.

2. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism in place to restrict who can call the `Deposit` and `CashOut` functions. Any address can deposit or cash out funds. It is recommended to implement access control to limit the functionality to authorized users.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The code does not explicitly check for integer overflow or underflow. Operations such as `balances[msg.sender] += msg.value` and `balances[msg.sender] -= _am` can potentially lead to arithmetic issues. It is important to add checks and handle potential overflow or underflow scenarios.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The low-level call in `CashOut` does not check the return value. If the call to `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` fails, the balance will still be deducted, resulting in funds being locked in the contract. It is recommended to handle the return value of low-level calls and revert the state changes if the call fails.

5. Denial of Service: The code does not have any gas limit checks, and an attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a large amount of gas to the contract. It is recommended to implement gas limit checks to prevent potential DoS attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not include any mechanism to generate random numbers. This can be exploited by malicious actors to manipulate the outcome of any randomization process in the contract. It is recommended to use a trusted external source for random number generation.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not handle potential front-running attacks. Front-running can occur when an attacker observes a pending transaction and quickly submits a transaction with a higher gas price to prioritize their transaction. It is recommended to implement measures to mitigate front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not protect against timestamp manipulation. The `now` variable is used to record the time of the transaction, but it can be manipulated by miners to potentially exploit time-based functions. It is recommended to use a trusted external time source or implement a time-based delay mechanism.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not include any protection against the short address attack. This attack can be used to exploit off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities. It is recommended to implement checks to prevent potential short address attacks.

To mitigate the identified vulnerabilities, the contract should be reviewed and updated accordingly. It is important to follow best practices for smart contract development and security.
