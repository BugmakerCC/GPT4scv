Here is an analysis of the given smart contract for the common vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdrawAll` function does not have any external calls, so there is no direct reentrancy vulnerability.

2. Access Control: The `withdrawAll` function uses the `require` statement to ensure that only the contract owner can call it. This provides basic access control.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the given contract, so there is no vulnerability related to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The `transfer` function used to send Ether to the `_recipient` returns a boolean value indicating the success or failure of the transfer. However, this return value is not checked, which can be a vulnerability.

5. Denial of Service: There are no specific vulnerabilities related to gas limit reached, unexpected throw, unexpected kill, or access control breach in the given contract.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no random number generation operations in the given contract, so this vulnerability is not applicable.

7. Front-Running: There are no specific vulnerabilities related to front-running in the given contract.

8. Time Manipulation: There are no timestamp dependencies in the given contract, so this vulnerability is not applicable.

9. Short Address Attack: There are no off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities in the given contract.

Overall, the given contract has vulnerabilities related to unchecked return values for low-level calls, as the return value of the `transfer` function is not checked. This can result in unexpected behavior if the transfer fails. It is recommended to handle the return value of the `transfer` function and take appropriate actions in case of failure.
