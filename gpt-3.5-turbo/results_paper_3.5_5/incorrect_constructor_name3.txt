The provided smart contract is vulnerable to the following vulnerabilities:

1. Access Control: The contract uses the `onlyowner` modifier to restrict access to the `withdraw` function. However, the contract lacks a proper constructor function. Instead, it has a function named `Constructor`. The lack of a proper constructor allows anyone to call the `Constructor` function and become the owner, bypassing the intended access control mechanism.

2. Short Address Attack: The `withdraw` function transfers the contract's balance to the `owner` address using `owner.transfer(this.balance)`. However, this transfer can be vulnerable to a short address attack. If an attacker sends a transaction with a short address as the `msg.sender`, it can cause the transfer to fail and potentially disrupt the contract's functionality.

To fix these vulnerabilities, you should make the following changes:

1. Rename the `Constructor` function to `constructor` to properly define the constructor function.

2. Add the `constructor` keyword before the function definition to mark it as the constructor function.

Here's the updated code with the fixes:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Missing {
    address private owner;

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function () payable {}

    function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```

These fixes address the identified vulnerabilities and improve the security of the smart contract.
