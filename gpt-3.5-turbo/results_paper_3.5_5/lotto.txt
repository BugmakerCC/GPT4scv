Here is an analysis of the provided smart contract for the nine common vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external function calls that can lead to reentrancy attacks. However, there is a potential vulnerability in the `sendToWinner` function. The `winner.send(winAmount)` line should be replaced with `winner.transfer(winAmount)` to prevent reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms implemented. It is important to consider who can call certain functions and restrict access to sensitive operations.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the contract, so there is no direct vulnerability related to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low Level Calls: The `send` function is used in the contract without checking its return value. This can lead to silent failure if the recipient contract's fallback function throws an exception. It is recommended to use `transfer` instead, which will automatically revert the transaction if the recipient contract's fallback function fails.

5. Denial of Service: There are no obvious denial of service vulnerabilities in this contract.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any randomness-related functions, so there is no direct vulnerability related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any functions that involve transaction ordering or time-dependent operations, so it is not vulnerable to front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical operations, so there is no direct vulnerability related to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any external function calls with variable length arguments, so it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.

To summarize, the contract has some potential vulnerabilities related to reentrancy and unchecked return values for low-level calls. It is recommended to address these issues by using `transfer` instead of `send` and implementing access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to critical functions.
