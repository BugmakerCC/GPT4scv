Here are the vulnerabilities that I have detected in the smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms, so anyone can call the functions and perform actions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could result in integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not have any low-level calls (e.g., call, delegatecall) that require return value checks.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit reached, unexpected throw, unexpected kill, or access control breach vulnerabilities.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses block.coinbase and msg.sender to generate random numbers, which can be influenced by miners or participants. This can lead to predictable outcomes and potentially unfair results.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any front-running vulnerabilities.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses block.number to determine the current block number. However, this can be manipulated by miners to control the outcome of the raffle.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract has vulnerabilities related to access control, randomness, and block number manipulation. These vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited by malicious actors.
