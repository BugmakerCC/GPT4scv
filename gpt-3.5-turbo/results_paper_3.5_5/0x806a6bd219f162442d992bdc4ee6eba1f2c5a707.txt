Upon analyzing the provided smart contract, I have identified several vulnerabilities. Let's go through each one step by step:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not contain any external function calls that could lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities. However, it's always recommended to carefully review any external contracts that are being called within the `Command` function.

2. Access Control: The contract uses a simple approach for access control by checking if the `msg.sender` is the same as the `Owner` address. However, the contract allows the owner address to be changed by calling the `withdraw` function and passing a specific address as the sender. This can be exploited by an attacker to gain control of the contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the provided contract, so there is no direct vulnerability related to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The contract uses a low-level call in the `Command` function to call another contract. However, it does not check the return value of the call, which can lead to a silent failure if the call fails. It's important to handle the return value and handle any potential errors appropriately.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any specific vulnerabilities related to gas limit reached, unexpected throw, or unexpected kill. However, the access control vulnerability mentioned earlier could potentially lead to denial of service if an attacker gains control of the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness, so there is no direct vulnerability related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not contain any specific vulnerabilities related to front-running. However, it's always recommended to consider potential race conditions and transaction ordering dependence when designing smart contracts.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps or time-dependent logic, so there is no direct vulnerability related to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not contain any specific vulnerabilities related to short address attacks or off-chain issues.

In summary, the main vulnerabilities found in the provided smart contract are access control and unchecked return values for low-level calls. It's crucial to review and address these vulnerabilities to ensure the security of the contract.
