Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external function calls, so there is no direct risk of reentrancy vulnerability.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the "Owner" variable to control access to certain functions, such as the "withdraw" and "Command" functions. However, the "Owner" variable is not properly initialized and can be changed by anyone by calling the "withdraw" function with a specific address as the sender. This makes it vulnerable to unauthorized access.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the contract, so it is not vulnerable to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not have any low-level calls, so there is no risk of unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: There are no specific vulnerabilities related to gas limit reached, unexpected throw, unexpected kill, or access control breach.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any randomness-related functions, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any functions that can be front-run.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any timestamp-dependent functions, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities.

In summary, the contract is vulnerable to the access control issue, where the "Owner" variable can be changed by anyone. This allows unauthorized access to the "withdraw" and "Command" functions.
