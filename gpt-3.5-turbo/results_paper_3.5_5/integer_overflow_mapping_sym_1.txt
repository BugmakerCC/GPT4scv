The given smart contract is susceptible to an integer underflow vulnerability. Here is an analysis of the vulnerabilities present in the code:

1. Integer Overflow/Underflow: The function `init` subtracts the value `v` from the mapping `map` at key `k`. However, if the initial value at key `k` is smaller than `v`, an integer underflow will occur, resulting in an unexpected and possibly incorrect value. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the mapping or cause unexpected behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the subtraction does not result in an underflow. One way to do that is by comparing the initial value at key `k` with `v` before subtracting. If the initial value is smaller than `v`, you can either revert the transaction or handle the error condition appropriately.

Here is the modified code with the fix:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.11;

contract IntegerOverflowMappingSym1 {
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) map;

    function init(uint256 k, uint256 v) public {
        require(map[k] >= v, "Value must be smaller or equal to initial value");
        
        map[k] -= v;
    }
}
```

By adding the `require` statement, we ensure that the subtraction does not result in an underflow. If the condition is not met, the transaction will revert and no changes will be made to the mapping.

Remember to thoroughly test the updated contract to ensure that the fix works as intended and does not introduce any new vulnerabilities.
