Based on the code provided, here are the vulnerabilities that exist in the smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks in the Collect function. After sending Ether to the address, the contract updates the balance before calling the external function. An attacker can exploit this by calling the Collect function repeatedly and executing malicious code during the external call.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place. Any user can call the Put and Collect functions, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no specific arithmetic issues in the contract.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses the low-level call.value()() function to send Ether, but it does not check the return value of the call. This can lead to silent failure if the external call fails.

5. Denial of Service: There are no specific denial of service vulnerabilities in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no specific randomness vulnerabilities in the contract.

7. Front-Running: There are no specific front-running vulnerabilities in the contract.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses the now variable for time-based checks. However, it is important to note that the now variable can be manipulated by miners to some extent, introducing a potential vulnerability.

9. Short Address Attack: There are no specific short address attack vulnerabilities in the contract.

It is recommended to address the vulnerabilities mentioned above to enhance the security of the smart contract.
