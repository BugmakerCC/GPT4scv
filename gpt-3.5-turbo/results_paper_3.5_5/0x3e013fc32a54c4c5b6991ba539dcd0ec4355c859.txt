After analyzing the smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities present:

1. Reentrancy: The `Command` function allows an arbitrary external contract to be called with `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)`. This can lead to a reentrancy vulnerability if the called contract executes a fallback function that calls back into the `MultiplicatorX4` contract before the state is updated.

2. Access Control: The `withdraw` and `Command` functions use `require(msg.sender == Owner)` to restrict access. However, there are no mechanisms in place to change the `Owner` address, making it a potential access control vulnerability.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in this contract, so there are no arithmetic issues present.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low Level Calls: The `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` in the `Command` function does not check the return value of the external call. This can lead to silent failures or unexpected behavior if the called contract fails or reverts.

5. Denial of Service: There are no explicit denial of service vulnerabilities in this contract.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no randomness-related functions in this contract, so there are no bad randomness vulnerabilities present.

7. Front-Running: There are no explicit front-running vulnerabilities in this contract.

8. Time Manipulation: There are no explicit time manipulation vulnerabilities in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: There are no short address attack vulnerabilities in this contract.

To summarize, the vulnerabilities present in the given smart contract are Reentrancy, Access Control, and Unchecked Return Values for Low Level Calls.
