Here is an analysis of the given smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The smart contract does not make any external contract calls, so there is no direct reentrancy vulnerability.

2. Access Control: The contract implements an ownership mechanism with the `Ownable` contract, where only the owner can change the owner and perform certain actions. However, there is a redundant `owner` variable declared in the `Token` contract, which can cause confusion.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the contract, so there is no direct vulnerability.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `WithdrawToken` function in the `Token` contract makes a low-level call to transfer tokens. However, it does not check the return value of the `call` function, which can lead to silent failing sends.

5. Denial of Service: There are no explicit denial of service vulnerabilities in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no randomness-related functions or variables in the contract.

7. Front-Running: There are no explicit front-running vulnerabilities in the contract.

8. Time manipulation: There are no explicit timestamp-related dependencies in the contract.

9. Short Address Attack: There are no off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities in the contract.

In summary, the contract has some potential vulnerabilities related to access control and unchecked return values for low-level calls. It is recommended to thoroughly review and address these issues before deploying the contract in a production environment.
