Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, there are several vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: The `Collect` function allows the holder to call an external contract using `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This can potentially lead to reentrancy attacks, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `Collect` function and drain the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: There are no access control mechanisms implemented in the contract. Anyone can call the `Put` and `Collect` functions, allowing potential unauthorized access to funds.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not handle potential integer overflow or underflow issues. This can lead to unexpected behavior when performing calculations, such as balance adjustments.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not check the return value of the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` function call. If the external contract execution fails, the state changes made within the `if` statement will not be reverted, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit checks, which can lead to potential denial of service attacks. An attacker can send a transaction with excessive gas, causing the contract execution to fail due to gas limit reached.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any randomness generation mechanism, which can be exploited by attackers to predict or manipulate outcomes.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not handle front-running attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the order of transactions to gain an unfair advantage. For example, an attacker can potentially submit a transaction to modify the `unlockTime` after another user has already called the `Collect` function.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract relies on the `now` keyword for time-related checks. However, the `now` timestamp can be manipulated by miners, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not implement any validation or checks for the length of the input data, which can be exploited by attackers to perform a short address attack.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, you should consider implementing the following measures:

1. Use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.
2. Implement access control mechanisms to restrict function calls to authorized users only.
3. Use safe arithmetic libraries or implement checks to prevent integer overflow and underflow issues.
4. Check the return value of low-level calls and revert state changes if the call fails.
5. Implement gas limit checks to prevent potential denial of service attacks.
6. Use a secure source of randomness for any random number generation requirements.
7. Implement safeguards to prevent front-running attacks, such as using commit-reveal schemes or timestamp dependencies.
8. Consider using a trusted timestamp oracle to avoid time manipulation vulnerabilities.
9. Implement input validation and ensure that the contract handles valid input data.

Additionally, it is recommended to thoroughly test the contract and perform a security audit to identify any other potential vulnerabilities.
