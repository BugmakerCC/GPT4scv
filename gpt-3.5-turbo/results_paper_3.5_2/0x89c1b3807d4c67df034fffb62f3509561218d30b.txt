Here are the vulnerabilities found in the provided smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls to other contracts, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call its functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract, so it is not vulnerable to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not use low-level calls (e.g., call, callcode, delegatecall), so it is not vulnerable to unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit reached or unexpected throw vulnerabilities. However, it does have a potential access control breach in the `upgrade` function, allowing the contract creator to upgrade the contract without any restrictions.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any random number generation, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any time-of-check vs time-of-use (TOCTOU) or race condition vulnerabilities.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any timestamp dependence vulnerabilities.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract does not have any critical vulnerabilities, but it could benefit from implementing access control mechanisms to restrict who can call its functions.
