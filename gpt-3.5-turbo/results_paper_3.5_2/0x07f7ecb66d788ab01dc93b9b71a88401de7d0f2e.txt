Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the common vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy:
   - The contract does not have any external function calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy.

2. Access Control:
   - The `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict access to certain functions, which is a good practice for access control.

3. Arithmetic Issues:
   - The contract does not have any arithmetic operations that could lead to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls:
   - The contract does not make any low-level calls, so there are no unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service:
   - The contract does not have any functionality that could lead to denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness:
   - The contract uses `keccak256` to generate randomness. This is a deterministic function and can be manipulated by miners. Consider using an external oracle for random number generation.

7. Front-Running:
   - The contract does not have any functionality that could be exploited by front-running attacks.

8. Time manipulation:
   - The contract does not rely on timestamps for critical operations, so time manipulation is not a concern.

9. Short Address Attack:
   - The contract does not have any functions that accept variable-length arguments, so it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the smart contract does not have any major vulnerabilities, but there are some areas for improvement. Consider using an external oracle for random number generation and adding more checks and validations for user inputs.
