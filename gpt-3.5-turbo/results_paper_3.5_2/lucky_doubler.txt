Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls to other contracts, so there is no possibility of a reentrancy vulnerability.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the "onlyowner" modifier to limit access to certain functions, ensuring that only the contract owner can execute them. This helps to prevent unauthorized access.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could result in integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does make use of low-level calls, but it checks the return value of the send function before proceeding with the payout. This helps to prevent silent failing sends.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any obvious denial of service vulnerabilities.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses a random number generation function that takes into account the previous block hash and the number of entries. While this method is not completely secure, it is acceptable for the purpose of this contract.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any explicit protection against front-running attacks. It is possible for an attacker to manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical operations, so there is no vulnerability related to timestamp manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any external function calls that could be vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the contract does not have any major vulnerabilities, but there are a few areas where additional security measures could be implemented, such as protection against front-running attacks and using a more secure random number generation method.
