Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `CashOut` function can be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it updates the balance before calling the `msg.sender.call.value()` function. This allows an attacker to recursively call the `CashOut` function and drain the contract's balance. To fix this vulnerability, the balance update should be done after the external call.

2. Access Control: The `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict certain functions to be called only by the contract owner. This helps with access control.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the contract, so there is no direct vulnerability related to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The `msg.sender.call.value()` function does not check the return value, which could lead to silent failures. It is important to handle the return value of external calls properly to avoid unexpected behavior.

5. Denial of Service: There are no explicit vulnerabilities related to gas limit reached, unexpected throw, unexpected kill, or breached access control.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no explicit vulnerabilities related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: There are no explicit vulnerabilities related to front-running, time-of-check vs time-of-use, or transaction ordering dependence.

8. Time Manipulation: There are no explicit vulnerabilities related to timestamp dependence.

9. Short Address Attack: There are no explicit vulnerabilities related to off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the main vulnerability in the smart contract is the potential for reentrancy attacks in the `CashOut` function. The other mentioned vulnerabilities do not seem to be present in the contract.
