Upon analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability involves a contract making an external call to another contract and allowing the called contract to call back into the calling contract before the initial call is completed. This vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract.

2. Access Control: Access control vulnerabilities occur when the contract does not properly restrict access to certain functions or data. In this contract, only the owner (feeAddress) can end the raffle, toggle the pause state, or kill the contract. This is not considered a vulnerability as long as the owner is a trusted entity.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not contain any explicit arithmetic operations that can result in integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: This vulnerability occurs when a contract interacts with other contracts using low-level calls (e.g., `call.value()()`) but fails to check the return value for success or failure. In this contract, the `msg.sender.transfer()` calls are used to send refunds or distribute funds, but the return value is not checked. This can potentially lead to a Denial of Service vulnerability if the transfer fails. It is recommended to handle the return value and implement appropriate error handling.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit vulnerabilities that could lead to a Denial of Service attack.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses a combination of `block.coinbase`, `msg.sender`, and `block.difficulty` to generate a random number. However, this method of generating randomness is insecure as it can be manipulated by miners or participants. An attacker could potentially influence the outcome of the raffle. It is recommended to use a more secure source of randomness, such as an external oracle or a verifiable random function (VRF).

7. Front-Running: Front-running attacks involve an attacker manipulating the order of transactions to their advantage. This contract does not contain any explicit vulnerabilities related to front-running.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on the current timestamp for critical functionality, and therefore, there are no apparent vulnerabilities related to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: Short address attack is a vulnerability that can occur when a contract does not validate the length of the input data. This contract does not contain any explicit vulnerabilities related to short address attacks.

Overall, the main vulnerabilities identified in this contract are the lack of proper return value checks for low-level calls and the use of insecure randomness generation. It is recommended to address these issues to enhance the security of the contract.
