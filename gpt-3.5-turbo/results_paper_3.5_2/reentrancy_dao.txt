Upon analyzing the provided smart contract, we can identify several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdrawAll` function allows users to withdraw their credit balance. However, it does not prevent reentrancy attacks. After deducting the credit from the balance, it calls the `msg.sender` contract, which can be an external contract. This allows an attacker to recursively call the `withdrawAll` function and drain the contract's balance. To fix this vulnerability, the state should be updated before making any external calls.

2. Denial of Service: The `withdrawAll` function does not check if the `oCredit` value is greater than the contract's balance. This allows an attacker to withdraw more credit than the contract holds, leading to a denial of service by depleting the contract's balance.

To address these vulnerabilities, the modified contract is as follows:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.19;

contract ReentrancyDAO {
    mapping (address => uint) credit;
    uint balance;

    function withdrawAll() public {
        uint oCredit = credit[msg.sender];
        require(oCredit > 0); // Check if the credit balance is greater than zero

        credit[msg.sender] = 0; // Update the state before making any external calls

        balance -= oCredit;

        bool callResult = msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)();
        require(callResult);
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        credit[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        balance += msg.value;
    }
}
```

By implementing these modifications, we ensure that the contract is more secure against reentrancy attacks and denial of service vulnerabilities.
