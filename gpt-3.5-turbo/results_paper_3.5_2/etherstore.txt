After analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that could be present:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it allows external contracts to call its functions, such as `msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)()`. An attacker could potentially call the `withdrawFunds` function multiple times before the balance is updated, leading to the contract being drained of funds.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms, meaning anyone can deposit and withdraw funds. It is advisable to implement an access control mechanism to restrict certain functions to authorized users only.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit checks for integer overflow and underflow in the contract. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the balances or withdrawal amounts exceed the maximum or minimum values of the data types used.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses `msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)()` to send Ether to the caller. However, it does not check the return value of this low-level call, which can lead to silent failures if the call fails or reverts.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit checks, which can allow users to consume all the gas in a block by repeatedly calling the functions. This can lead to a denial of service for other transactions in the block.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any source of randomness, which can be easily manipulated by miners or other participants to their advantage.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any mechanisms to prevent front-running attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses `now` to check the last withdrawal time. However, `now` can be manipulated by miners to some extent, and this could be exploited to bypass the time limit for withdrawals.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not explicitly check for the length of the `msg.data` when handling external calls, which can make it vulnerable to short address attacks.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the contract should be reviewed and updated accordingly.
