After carefully reviewing the provided smart contract, I have identified the following vulnerabilities:

1. Bad Randomness: The contract uses the `block.timestamp` as the salt for generating random numbers. However, `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners to some extent, making the randomness predictable and exploitable.

2. Time manipulation: The contract relies on the `block.number` and `blockhash` functions for generating random numbers. However, these values can be manipulated by miners within certain limitations. Miners can potentially control the block number and manipulate the `blockhash` to influence the generated random number.

To improve the contract and address these vulnerabilities, it is recommended to use an external and reliable source of randomness, such as an oracle service or a verifiable randomness protocol. Additionally, it is crucial to carefully consider the potential impact of manipulating timestamps and block numbers on the contract's logic and security.
