Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls or interact with other contracts, so the reentrancy vulnerability is not present.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place, allowing anyone to call the functions and claim the throne.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract that could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses the `send` function to send ether to addresses. This function does not throw an exception if the transfer fails, which could lead to potential vulnerabilities.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit gas limits or checks that could prevent a denial of service attack.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any random number generation mechanism and relies on the block timestamp for certain calculations. This could potentially lead to predictable outcomes.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any specific measures to prevent front-running attacks. The order of transactions can potentially be manipulated by miners.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract relies on the block timestamp for certain calculations. However, there are no checks in place to prevent manipulation of the timestamp.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any functions that can be vulnerable to short address attacks.

Please note that these are initial observations based on a code review. Further analysis and testing may be required to identify additional vulnerabilities or confirm the presence of the identified vulnerabilities.
