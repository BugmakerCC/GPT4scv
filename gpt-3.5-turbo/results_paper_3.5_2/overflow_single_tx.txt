Based on the given smart contract, here is an analysis of the vulnerabilities mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: There are no external contract calls, so this vulnerability does not exist in this contract.

2. Access Control: There are no access control mechanisms implemented in this contract, so it is susceptible to unauthorized access.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract contains multiple arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, subtraction) without checks for overflow or underflow. This can lead to unintended behavior and vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: There are no low-level calls in this contract, so this vulnerability does not exist.

5. Denial of Service: There are no explicit denial of service vulnerabilities in this contract.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no random number generation operations in this contract, so this vulnerability does not exist.

7. Front-Running: There are no race conditions or transaction ordering dependencies in this contract, so this vulnerability does not exist.

8. Time Manipulation: There are no timestamp dependencies or manipulations in this contract, so this vulnerability does not exist.

9. Short Address Attack: There are no off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities in this contract, so this vulnerability does not exist.

In summary, the vulnerabilities present in this contract are access control issues and arithmetic issues (integer overflow and underflow). These vulnerabilities should be addressed to ensure the contract's security.
