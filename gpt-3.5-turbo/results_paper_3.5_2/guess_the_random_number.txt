After reviewing the given smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that I have identified:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls, so there is no risk of reentrancy in this contract.
2. Access Control: There is no explicit access control mechanism implemented in this contract.
3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations that could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow.
4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: There are no low-level calls (e.g., call, delegatecall, etc.) in this contract, so there are no unchecked return values.
5. Denial of Service: There are no gas limit-related issues or unexpected throws that could lead to a denial of service attack.
6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses the `blockhash` and `now` to generate a random number. However, it is important to note that `blockhash` can only access the most recent 256 block hashes, and `now` can be manipulated by miners. This can potentially lead to a predictable or manipulatable random number.
7. Front-Running: There are no time-of-check vs time-of-use issues or race conditions in this contract.
8. Time Manipulation: The contract does use `now`, which can be manipulated by miners. However, in this contract, it is not directly used to make any critical decisions or calculations.
9. Short Address Attack: There are no off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities present in this contract.

Overall, the main vulnerability in this contract is the reliance on `blockhash` and `now` for generating a random number, which may not be truly random and could be manipulated by miners.
