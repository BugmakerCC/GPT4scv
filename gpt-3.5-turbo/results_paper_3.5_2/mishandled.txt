The given smart contract is susceptible to the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdrawBalance` function allows users to withdraw their balance. However, it does not prevent reentrant calls, which could allow an attacker to repeatedly call the `withdrawBalance` function before the balance update is executed, leading to loss of funds.

2. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism in place to restrict who can call the `withdrawBalance` function. This means that anyone can call this function and withdraw the balance of any user.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `send` function is used to transfer funds to the `msg.sender`. However, it does not check the return value of the `send` function, which can fail silently in case of an error. This can result in the loss of funds if the transfer fails.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the following changes can be made to the smart contract:

pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
contract SendBack {
    mapping (address => uint) userBalances;
    mapping (address => bool) isLocked;
    
    function withdrawBalance() public {
        require(!isLocked[msg.sender], "Withdrawal is locked.");
        
        uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
        userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
        
        isLocked[msg.sender] = true; // Set the lock to prevent reentrancy attacks
        
        require(msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)(), "Transfer failed.");
        
        isLocked[msg.sender] = false; // Release the lock
    }
}

In the updated contract, the `withdrawBalance` function includes the following improvements:

- The function is made `public` to allow anyone to call it.
- An additional `isLocked` mapping is introduced to prevent reentrant calls by locking the withdrawal process for each user.
- The `require` statement is added to check if the withdrawal is locked for the user.
- The `require` statement is added to check if the transfer of funds is successful.
- The lock is released after the transfer is completed to prevent further reentrant calls.
