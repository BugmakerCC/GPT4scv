Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the nine common vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract has an "owner" variable, but it is only used to restrict certain functions to the owner. The owner can add new puppets and update the "extra" mapping. There are no checks to ensure that only the owner can call these functions, so there is a potential access control vulnerability.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, which protects against integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract makes low-level calls to other contracts, but it does not check the return values. This can lead to silent failing sends and unchecked-send vulnerabilities.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any obvious denial of service vulnerabilities.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness, so there are no bad randomness vulnerabilities.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any obvious front-running vulnerabilities.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any obvious time manipulation vulnerabilities.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any obvious short address attack vulnerabilities.

In summary, the contract has potential vulnerabilities in access control and unchecked return values for low-level calls. Further analysis and testing is needed to determine the actual security of the contract.
