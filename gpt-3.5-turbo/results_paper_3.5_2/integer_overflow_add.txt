After analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities it may have:

1. Integer Overflow: The `run` function adds the `input` parameter to the `count` variable without any checks for potential overflow. If the `input` value is large enough, it can cause an integer overflow.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you can add a check to ensure that the addition operation does not result in an overflow. One possible solution is to use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations.

2. Access Control: The smart contract does not have any access control mechanisms defined. This means that anyone can call the `run` function and modify the `count` variable.

To address this vulnerability, you can implement an access control mechanism such as a modifier that restricts the execution of the `run` function to only authorized users.

Here's an updated version of the smart contract that addresses these vulnerabilities:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.19;

import "./SafeMath.sol";

contract IntegerOverflowAdd {
    using SafeMath for uint256;
    
    uint public count = 1;
    address public owner;
    
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the contract owner can call this function");
        _;
    }
    
    function IntegerOverflowAdd() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function run(uint256 input) public onlyOwner {
        count = count.add(input);
    }
}
```

In the updated contract, the `SafeMath` library is used for safe arithmetic operations, and an `onlyOwner` modifier is added to restrict access to the `run` function. The contract owner is set in the constructor.
