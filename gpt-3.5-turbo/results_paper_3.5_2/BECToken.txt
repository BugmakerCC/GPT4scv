After carefully reviewing the smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that I have identified:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external function calls or transfers, so there is no direct vulnerability for reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to execute the transfer and other functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The SafeMath library is used to prevent arithmetic issues such as integer overflow and integer underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: There are no low-level calls in the contract, so this vulnerability is not present.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any specific mechanisms to prevent denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness, so this vulnerability is not present.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any critical functions that could be front-run.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any time-dependent functions that could be manipulated.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract does not have any major vulnerabilities. However, it lacks access control and mechanisms to prevent denial of service attacks.
