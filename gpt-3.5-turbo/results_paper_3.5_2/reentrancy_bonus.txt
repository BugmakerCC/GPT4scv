Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks in the `withdrawReward` function. This vulnerability occurs when a contract calls an external contract that then reverts control back to the calling contract before completing its execution. An attacker can exploit this by repeatedly calling the `withdrawReward` function to drain the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism implemented in the contract. Any address can call the `withdrawReward` and `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` functions, potentially leading to unauthorized access to rewards and bonus claiming.

To fix these vulnerabilities, consider the following changes:

1. Reentrancy: Implement the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern by moving the balance update before the external call. This prevents reentrancy attacks because the contract's state is updated before interacting with external contracts.

```solidity
function withdrawReward(address recipient) public {
    uint amountToWithdraw = rewardsForA[recipient];
    rewardsForA[recipient] = 0;
    
    require(recipient.call.value(amountToWithdraw)(""));
}
```

2. Access Control: Add a modifier or require statement to ensure that only authorized addresses can call the `withdrawReward` and `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` functions.

```solidity
modifier onlyAuthorized() {
    require(msg.sender == authorizedAddress);
    _;
}

function withdrawReward(address recipient) public onlyAuthorized {
    ...
}

function getFirstWithdrawalBonus(address recipient) public onlyAuthorized {
    ...
}
```

Please note that additional considerations may need to be made depending on the specific requirements of your smart contract. It is always recommended to follow best practices and conduct thorough testing to ensure the security of your smart contracts.
