The smart contract provided appears to have the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: There is a call to the "c" contract in the tokens_buy function, which could potentially allow an attacker to call back into the Delta contract before the state changes are complete. This could lead to a reentrancy attack.

2. Access Control: The owner and owner2 variables are used to control certain functions, but there is no proper access control mechanism in place to restrict who can call these functions. As a result, anyone can call the withdraw, change_token_price, and change_active functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit checks for integer overflow or underflow in the tokens_buy function when calculating the tokens to be transferred. This could potentially lead to arithmetic issues if the input values are large.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The return value of the c.call function in the tokens_buy function is not checked. If the transferFrom function fails, the tokens_buy function will still return true, misleading the caller.

5. Denial of Service: There is no gas limit check in the tokens_buy function. If an attacker sends a large amount of ether, it could potentially lead to a denial of service by exhausting the contract's gas limit.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no random number generation mechanisms in the contract, which could potentially lead to predictable or biased outcomes.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not include any protections against front-running attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage.

8. Time manipulation: There are no checks to prevent manipulation of the timestamp, which could potentially be exploited by an attacker to gain an advantage.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not include any checks for short addresses, which could potentially be abused by an attacker to modify the contract's storage.

It is important to note that this analysis is based on a high-level review of the contract and may not capture all possible vulnerabilities. A more comprehensive security audit is recommended before deploying this contract to a production environment.
