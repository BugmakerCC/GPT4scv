Upon analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities identified:

1. Reentrancy: The `CashOut` function allows the caller to withdraw funds from their balance. However, it does not update the `lastBlock` variable before making the external call. This leaves the contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks if the external contract being called is malicious and initiates another call to the `CashOut` function before the balance is updated.

2. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism in place to restrict who can call the `Deposit` and `CashOut` functions. This means anyone can deposit or withdraw funds from any account.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit checks for integer overflow or underflow in the contract. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the contract deals with large numbers or performs arithmetic operations.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `CashOut` function does not check the return value of the external call made using `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This can lead to silent failures if the external contract being called fails to execute properly.

5. Denial of Service: There are no gas limit checks in the contract, allowing an attacker to potentially consume all available gas by performing expensive operations. Additionally, there are no checks to prevent unexpected throws or kills that can disrupt the normal functioning of the contract. Moreover, the contract does not enforce any access control measures, allowing an attacker to manipulate balances.

6. Bad Randomness: There is no use of randomness generation in the contract, which might be required for certain applications. This vulnerability is not directly exploitable but can impact the security of the contract if randomness is needed.

7. Front-Running: The contract is not vulnerable to front-running attacks as there are no critical operations that can be exploited by an attacker's manipulation of transaction ordering.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not explicitly rely on the timestamp for any critical operations. However, there is a timestamp dependency in the `Log` contract, where the `Time` field is set using `now`. This can be manipulated by miners if they have control over the order of transaction inclusion in the block.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not contain any off-chain calls or client interactions, so it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.

To improve the security of the contract, you should consider implementing the following mitigations:

- Implement proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can deposit or withdraw funds.
- Add checks for integer overflow and underflow to prevent unexpected behavior.
- Always check the return value of external calls and handle failures appropriately.
- Implement gas limit checks to prevent denial of service attacks.
- Consider using a reliable source of randomness if required.
- Be cautious about timestamp dependencies and potential manipulations.
- Ensure that external dependencies, such as the `Log` contract, are also secure and free from vulnerabilities.
