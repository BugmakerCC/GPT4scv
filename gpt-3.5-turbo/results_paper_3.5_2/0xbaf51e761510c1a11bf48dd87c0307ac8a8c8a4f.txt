After analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: The `CashOut` function may be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The contract first updates the balance of the sender and then calls the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` function, which allows the called contract to execute arbitrary code. This can potentially lead to a reentrancy attack if the called contract calls back into the `ETH_VAULT` contract before the balance is updated.

2. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism implemented in the `ETH_VAULT` contract. Any address can call the `Deposit` and `CashOut` functions, which may lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract's state.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit checks for arithmetic issues such as integer overflow and underflow in the contract. These issues can potentially lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses the `call.value` function to send ether to the sender in the `CashOut` function. However, it does not check the return value of the `call` function, which can result in a silent failure if the called contract rejects the transfer.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit checks or mechanisms to prevent denial-of-service attacks. An attacker can potentially exhaust all the gas by calling the `Deposit` or `CashOut` functions with a large amount of gas, causing other transactions to fail.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any mechanism to generate or use random numbers. This can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the contract's behavior or make predictions.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any protections against front-running attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses `now` to store the timestamp of the last message. However, `now` can be manipulated by miners to some extent, which can potentially lead to vulnerabilities.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not implement any checks for short address attacks, where an attacker can send a transaction with a short address, potentially leading to issues in the contract's data parsing.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the following steps can be taken:

1. Implement a reentrancy guard in the `CashOut` function to prevent reentrancy attacks.
2. Implement an access control mechanism to restrict the usage of the `Deposit` and `CashOut` functions to authorized addresses.
3. Add checks to prevent arithmetic issues such as integer overflow and underflow.
4. Check the return value of the `call` function in the `CashOut` function to handle failures appropriately.
5. Implement gas limit checks and other mechanisms to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
6. Use a secure source of randomness or implement a verifiable random function (VRF) to ensure randomness in the contract.
7. Implement protections against front-running attacks, such as using commit-reveal schemes or implementing strict ordering mechanisms.
8. Consider using block numbers instead of timestamps to avoid potential time manipulation attacks.
9. Implement checks for short address attacks during data parsing.

By addressing these vulnerabilities, the security of the smart contract can be significantly improved.
