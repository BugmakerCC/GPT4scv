Here is the analysis of the smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external function calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract uses a simple owner check using `tx.origin`. This is not a recommended method for access control as it can be easily spoofed. It is better to use `msg.sender` instead.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the contract, so there is no vulnerability related to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The `transfer` function used in the `withdrawAll` function automatically throws an exception if the transfer fails. So, the return value is checked and the contract is not vulnerable to this issue.

5. Denial of Service: There are no loops or complex operations that can lead to a denial of service attack. However, the contract does not have any gas limit checks for the `transfer` function, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors if the recipient contract has a complex fallback function.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness, so this vulnerability is not applicable.

7. Front-Running: There are no scenarios in the contract where front-running can occur.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on the timestamp for any critical operations, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any payable functions that accept external input, so it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the contract is relatively simple and does not have any major vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to improve the access control mechanism and consider gas limit checks for the `transfer` function to enhance security.
