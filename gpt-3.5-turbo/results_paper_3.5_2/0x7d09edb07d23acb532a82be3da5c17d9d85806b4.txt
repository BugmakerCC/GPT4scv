Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the vulnerabilities mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls, so there is no direct reentrancy vulnerability.
2. Access Control: The contract uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict certain functions to the contract owner.
3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could result in overflow or underflow.
4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls using `call` or `delegatecall` functions.
5. Denial of Service: There are no gas limit reached vulnerabilities, unexpected throws, or unexpected kills in the contract. However, there is a potential access control breach vulnerability in the `donateToWhale` and `loseWager` functions, as they make a call to the `whale` address without checking the return value.
6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses the `blockhash` function to generate random numbers for gameplay. However, this is not a secure source of randomness as it can be manipulated by miners. Consider using an external random number generator.
7. Front-Running: The contract does not handle front-running vulnerabilities explicitly.
8. Time manipulation: The contract does not have any explicit timestamp dependence vulnerabilities.
9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract does not seem to have any critical vulnerabilities. However, there are some potential access control breaches and the use of `blockhash` for randomness generation is not secure. Additionally, it is important to thoroughly test the contract for any unforeseen vulnerabilities.
