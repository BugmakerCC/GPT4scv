The provided smart contract does not have all the mentioned vulnerabilities. However, it does have one vulnerability, which is the "Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls" (SWC-104).

In the `callnotchecked` function, the `callee.call()` statement does not check the return value for success or failure. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the called contract reverts or throws an exception.

To fix this vulnerability, you should always check the return value of low-level calls and handle any potential errors appropriately. Here's an updated version of the contract that addresses this issue:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.4.25;

contract ReturnValue {
  function callchecked(address callee) public returns (bool) {
    require(callee.call());
    return true;
  }

  function callnotchecked(address callee) public returns (bool) {
    bool success;
    bytes memory data;
    (success, data) = callee.call();
    require(success);
    return true;
  }
}
```

In the `callnotchecked` function, we added a `bool success` variable to capture the return value of the `callee.call()` statement. Then, we check the `success` variable and require it to be true before proceeding. This ensures that any failure or exception thrown by the called contract is properly handled.
