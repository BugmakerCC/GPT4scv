After carefully reviewing the smart contract, here is an analysis of the vulnerabilities present:

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability occurs when an external contract can call back into the contract before the first call is completed. In this contract, there is a potential reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function. The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` without implementing any checks to prevent reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: This vulnerability refers to the lack of proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized users to interact with sensitive functions or data. This smart contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, making all functions publicly accessible.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not contain explicit arithmetic operations that may result in integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` to send ether to the `msg.sender` address. However, it does not check the return value of this low-level call. If the call fails, the contract will not handle the failure or revert the state.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit denial of service vulnerabilities, such as gas limit reached or unexpected throw.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any random number generation, so there is no vulnerability related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not contain any explicit front-running vulnerabilities.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses the `now` keyword to check the current timestamp. However, there are no explicit vulnerabilities related to timestamp manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not involve any off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, this contract has potential vulnerabilities related to reentrancy and access control. It is recommended to implement proper access control mechanisms and use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks. Additionally, it is important to carefully handle low-level call return values and consider implementing additional security measures to address other potential vulnerabilities.
