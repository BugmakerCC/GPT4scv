The provided smart contract does not contain all the mentioned vulnerabilities. However, there is one vulnerability that can be identified in the contract:

1. Access Control: The contract uses a modifier `onlyowner` to restrict certain functions to be called only by the contract owner. However, there is no constructor defined with the name `Constructor`. The constructor should be defined with the same name as the contract, i.e., `Missing`. This means that the `onlyowner` modifier will not be applied, and anyone will be able to call the `withdraw` function.

Here is the corrected version of the contract with the fixed constructor name:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Missing {
    address private owner;

    modifier onlyowner {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }
    
    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function () payable {}

    function withdraw() public onlyowner {
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```

This version fixes the vulnerability by correctly defining the constructor name as `constructor`.
