Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls using the "call" or "delegatecall" functions, so it does not have a reentrancy vulnerability.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the "onlyOwner" modifier to restrict access to certain functions, which provides some level of access control.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could result in integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses the "call" function without checking the return value. This can be a vulnerability if the called contract has a fallback function that can execute arbitrary code. However, since the contract does not make any external calls using the "call" function, this vulnerability is not present.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit reached, unexpected throw, unexpected kill, or access control breaches that could result in a denial of service vulnerability.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses the "blockhash" function to generate a random number. However, this is not a secure way to generate random numbers as it can be manipulated by miners. This can be considered a bad randomness vulnerability.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any time-of-check vs time-of-use (TOCTOU), race condition, or transaction ordering dependence vulnerabilities.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any timestamp dependence vulnerabilities.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract has some vulnerabilities, such as bad randomness, but it does not have any critical vulnerabilities like reentrancy or access control breaches.
