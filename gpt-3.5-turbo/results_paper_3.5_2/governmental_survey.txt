After analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities it contains:

1. Reentrancy: The `resetInvestment` function can be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `resetInvestment` function repeatedly before the balance transfers are completed, allowing the attacker to drain the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place. Any address can call the `invest` and `resetInvestment` functions, potentially leading to unauthorized access and manipulation of contract state.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not handle arithmetic issues such as integer overflow and underflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not check the return values of the `send` function calls in the `resetInvestment` function. This can lead to silent failures and the loss of funds without the contract being aware.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit checks, allowing an attacker to potentially consume all the gas and prevent other transactions from being executed.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have a secure source of randomness, which can be exploited by attackers to predict outcomes and manipulate contract behavior.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have measures to prevent front-running attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the order of transactions to gain an unfair advantage.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract relies on the `block.timestamp` for timestamp-based logic. However, this can be manipulated by miners, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not handle the short address attack, which can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the contract execution and potentially cause unexpected behavior.

It is recommended to address these vulnerabilities to ensure the smart contract's security and integrity.
