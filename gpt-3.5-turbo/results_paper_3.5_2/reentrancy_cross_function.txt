Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, there are several vulnerabilities present:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdrawBalance` function allows the user to withdraw their balance, but it does not prevent reentrancy attacks. After transferring the balance to the user, it calls the `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("")` function, which enables an external contract to execute code in this contract before the state is updated. This can lead to reentrant calls and potential loss of funds.

2. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism in place to restrict who can call the `transfer` and `withdrawBalance` functions. This means anyone can execute these functions and manipulate the user balances.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no checks for integer overflow or underflow in the `transfer` function. If an attacker sends a large amount that causes an overflow, it can lead to incorrect balance calculations and manipulation.

4. Unchecked Return Values: The return value of the low-level call in the `withdrawBalance` function is not checked. If the call fails, it will silently continue executing, leading to potential issues and unhandled errors.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any mechanisms to prevent denial of service attacks. For example, an attacker can repeatedly call the `transfer` function with a large amount, depleting the contract's balance and causing it to stop functioning as intended.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the following steps can be taken:

- Implement a mutex or reentrancy guard to prevent reentrant calls in the `withdrawBalance` function.
- Add access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can call the `transfer` and `withdrawBalance` functions.
- Include checks for integer overflow and underflow in the `transfer` function to prevent arithmetic issues.
- Check the return value of the low-level call in the `withdrawBalance` function and handle any failures appropriately.
- Implement gas limits and other mechanisms to prevent denial of service attacks.

By addressing these vulnerabilities, the smart contract can be made more secure.
