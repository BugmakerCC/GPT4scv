Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external function calls that could potentially lead to reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the "onlyOwner" modifier to restrict access to certain functions, ensuring that only the contract owner can execute them.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could lead to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses the "call.value" function to execute a low-level call, but it does not check the return value. This could potentially lead to a silent failure if the call fails.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any vulnerabilities that could lead to denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not rely on any randomness or secret values.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any vulnerabilities that could lead to front-running attacks.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on the timestamp for any critical operations.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any external function calls that could be vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the smart contract appears to be secure against the vulnerabilities you mentioned. However, it is always recommended to conduct a thorough security audit of the contract to ensure that no other vulnerabilities are present.
