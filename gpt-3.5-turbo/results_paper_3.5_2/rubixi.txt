After analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external function calls that could potentially lead to reentrancy attacks. 

2. Access Control: The contract uses the `onlyowner` modifier to restrict certain functions to be called only by the creator of the contract. However, it does not enforce this modifier in the constructor function, allowing anyone to set themselves as the creator of the contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not have any explicit checks for integer overflow or underflow. However, in the `addPayout` function, there is a multiplication operation that could potentially overflow if the pyramidMultiplier or the feePercent variables are set to very large values.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The contract uses the `send` function to transfer ether to participants. This function returns a boolean value indicating the success or failure of the transfer. However, the return value is not checked, which could result in silent failing sends.

5. Denial of Service: There are no explicit denial of service vulnerabilities in the contract. However, if the number of participants becomes very large, the loop in the `addPayout` function that pays out participants could consume a significant amount of gas, potentially causing the contract to run out of gas.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any functionality that relies on randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any explicit front-running vulnerabilities.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any explicit timestamp dependencies.

9. Short Address Attack: There are no short address attack vulnerabilities in the contract.

It is important to note that this analysis is based on a static review of the contract and does not take into account potential vulnerabilities that may arise from interactions with other contracts or external systems. A thorough security review and testing should be conducted to identify any additional vulnerabilities.
