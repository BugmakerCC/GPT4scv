Analysis:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external function calls, so there is no risk of reentrancy vulnerability.

2. Access Control: The contract implements an ownership mechanism using the Ownable contract. Only the owner can change the owner and withdraw tokens.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract, so there is no risk of integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract calls the `transfer` function of the token contract, but it does not check the return value. This can potentially lead to silent failing sends if the token contract's `transfer` function returns false on failure. It is recommended to check the return value and handle failures appropriately.

5. Denial of Service: There are no gas limit reached vulnerabilities, unexpected throws, or unexpected kills in the contract. However, the access control mechanism could be breached if the ownership is transferred to a malicious address.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no randomness-related vulnerabilities in the contract.

7. Front-Running: There are no time-of-check vs time-of-use vulnerabilities or transaction ordering dependence vulnerabilities in the contract.

8. Time Manipulation: There are no timestamp dependencies in the contract.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract is relatively secure but could benefit from additional checks and handling of return values for low-level calls. It is recommended to thoroughly test the contract and ensure that the access control mechanism cannot be breached.
