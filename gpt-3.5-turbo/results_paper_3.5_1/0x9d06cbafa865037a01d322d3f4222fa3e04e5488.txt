Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls, so there is no vulnerability related to reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract has a modifier "onlyOwner" that restricts certain functions to be executed only by the owner. This provides access control to the owner.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract that could lead to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses the "call" function to transfer tokens, but it checks the return value and returns false if the transfer fails. Therefore, it handles the return value properly.

5. Denial of Service: There are no vulnerabilities related to gas limit reached, unexpected throw, unexpected kill, or breached access control.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no random number generators in the contract, so there is no vulnerability related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: There are no time-dependent operations that could be exploited for front-running.

8. Time Manipulation: There are no time-dependent operations that could be manipulated.

9. Short Address Attack: There are no off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities in the contract.

In conclusion, the smart contract does not have any of the vulnerabilities you mentioned. However, it is always recommended to thoroughly review and test the contract to ensure its security.
