The provided smart contract is vulnerable to the Reentrancy vulnerability. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in the contract:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdrawBalance` function allows users to withdraw their balance from the contract. However, it uses the `call.value` method to send the balance to the user's address. This method can execute arbitrary code in the receiving contract, potentially allowing an attacker to re-enter the `withdrawBalance` function before the balance is set to zero, leading to repeated withdrawals and draining of the contract's balance.

To fix this vulnerability, you should follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. This means that you should first update the balance of the user to zero before executing the external call. Here's an example of how to fix the `withdrawBalance` function:

```solidity
function withdrawBalance() {
    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
        
    if (!(msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)())) {
        revert();
    }
}
```

This change ensures that the balance is set to zero before any external call is made, preventing the reentrancy vulnerability.

It's important to note that the other mentioned vulnerabilities (Access Control, Arithmetic Issues, Unchecked Return Values, Denial of Service, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, and Short Address Attack) are not present in the given smart contract. However, it's always a good practice to consider these vulnerabilities when developing smart contracts.
