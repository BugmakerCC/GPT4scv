Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, here is the analysis for each of the nine common vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls to other contracts, so reentrancy is not a concern in this case.

2. Access Control: The contract uses a modifier called "onlyOwner" to restrict certain functions to be called only by the owner. This is a basic access control mechanism, but it could be enhanced by using a more secure approach like the OpenZeppelin Ownable contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls that require checking the return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any code paths that could lead to gas limit reached, unexpected throw, unexpected kill, or access control breaches.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not generate or use any random numbers, so bad randomness is not a concern.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any critical sections where front-running attacks could occur.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for critical logic, so time manipulation is not a concern.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any functions that are vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the provided smart contract seems to be free from the common vulnerabilities mentioned. However, it is always recommended to conduct a thorough security audit to ensure the contract is secure.
