Based on the provided smart contract, here is the analysis for the vulnerabilities mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract. The contract does not call any external contracts, and it does not have any recursive calls.

2. Access Control: This vulnerability is present in the given smart contract. The constructor function `initWallet()` is wrongly named and can be called by anyone, allowing anyone to become the creator and withdraw all funds.

3. Arithmetic Issues: This vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract. The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could lead to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: This vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract. The contract does not make any low-level calls using `call()` or `delegatecall()` functions.

5. Denial of Service: This vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract. The contract does not have any gas limit issues, unexpected throw or kill, or breach of access control.

6. Bad Randomness: This vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract. The contract does not involve any randomness.

7. Front-Running: This vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract. The contract does not have any time-dependent operations or transaction ordering dependencies.

8. Time Manipulation: This vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract. The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical operations.

9. Short Address Attack: This vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract. The contract does not involve any off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the main vulnerability in this smart contract is the lack of access control in the constructor function, allowing anyone to become the creator and withdraw all funds.
