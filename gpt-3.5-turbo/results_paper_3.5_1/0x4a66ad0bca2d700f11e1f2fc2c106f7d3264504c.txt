Here is the analysis of the smart contract for the nine common vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract has a require statement that checks if the caller is a specific address. This provides some level of access control, but it is recommended to have more granular access control mechanisms.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in this contract, so it is not vulnerable to arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low Level Calls: The contract uses the `call` function to invoke the `transferFrom` function of another contract. It is important to check the return value of this `call` function to handle any potential errors. In this case, the return value is not checked, so it is vulnerable to unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: There are no gas limit related vulnerabilities or unexpected throws in this contract. The access control check prevents unauthorized access.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no random number generation mechanisms in this contract, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: There are no time-dependent operations in this contract, so it is not vulnerable to front-running.

8. Time Manipulation: There are no timestamp dependencies in this contract, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities, so it is not vulnerable to a short address attack.

Overall, this contract is vulnerable to unchecked return values for low-level calls. It is recommended to check the return value of the `call` function to handle any potential errors.
