After analyzing the provided smart contract, here is an assessment of the vulnerabilities mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls or interact with other contracts, so there are no reentrancy vulnerabilities present.

2. Access Control: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the `sendCoin` and `getBalance` functions. This can be considered a vulnerability if only certain addresses should be allowed to perform these actions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract that could lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls, so there are no unchecked return value vulnerabilities.

5. Denial of Service: There are no specific vulnerabilities related to denial of service attacks in this contract.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not rely on random numbers, so there are no vulnerabilities related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not involve any critical operations where front-running attacks could occur.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps or time-dependent functions, so there are no time manipulation vulnerabilities.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not accept any external input in the form of an address, so there are no vulnerabilities related to short address attacks.

Overall, the provided smart contract does not seem to have any of the mentioned vulnerabilities. However, it lacks access control mechanisms, which could be considered a vulnerability depending on the intended functionality of the contract.
