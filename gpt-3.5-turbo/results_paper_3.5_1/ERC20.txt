Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, here is an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls that could lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms. This means that any address can call the transfer, approve, transferFrom, balanceOf, and allowance functions. This can be a potential vulnerability if there are intended restrictions on who can perform these actions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The SafeMath library is used to prevent arithmetic overflow and underflow issues. Therefore, the contract is safe from these vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls (e.g., call, delegatecall, etc.). Therefore, there are no unchecked return values that could lead to vulnerabilities.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit denial of service vulnerabilities. However, it is worth noting that the require statements used in the contract can consume a significant amount of gas, potentially leading to a denial of service attack if an attacker repeatedly calls functions with invalid input.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any randomness-based functionalities. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to bad randomness vulnerabilities.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any susceptible functions that could lead to front-running vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any time-dependent functionalities or reliance on timestamps. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any payable functions that could be susceptible to short address attacks. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the provided smart contract is relatively secure and does not exhibit any of the mentioned vulnerabilities except for the lack of access control. Consider implementing access control mechanisms if specific restrictions are desired.
