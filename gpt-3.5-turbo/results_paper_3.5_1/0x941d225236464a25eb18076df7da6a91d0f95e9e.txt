After carefully reviewing the smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that could potentially exist:

1. Reentrancy: The `CashOut` function is susceptible to reentrancy attacks. After transferring funds to the caller using `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`, the contract updates the balance without considering that the external call might execute arbitrary code that could call the `CashOut` function again before the balance is updated.

2. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism implemented in this contract. Any address can call the `Deposit` and `CashOut` functions without any restrictions. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of funds.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit checks for integer overflow or underflow in the contract. This can potentially lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities if arithmetic operations are not handled properly.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: In the `CashOut` function, the return value of the external call `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is not checked. If the call fails, the contract still updates the balance without reverting the transaction, potentially leading to funds getting stuck.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any mechanisms to prevent or mitigate denial of service attacks. For example, an attacker could repeatedly call the `Deposit` function with a small amount of gas, causing the contract to run out of gas and preventing other users from interacting with it.

6. Bad Randomness: There is no randomness generation mechanism implemented in the contract. This could be an issue if the contract relies on random values for any critical functionality, as the lack of randomness can be exploited by attackers.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any measures to prevent front-running attacks. Transactions can be reordered by miners, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the order and take advantage of it.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses the `now` keyword to get the current timestamp. However, this can be manipulated by miners to some extent. If the contract relies on accurate timestamps for critical functionality, it could be vulnerable to manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not explicitly check for short address attacks in the `CashOut` function. If a caller sends a transaction with a short address, it could potentially lead to the contract malfunctioning or behaving unexpectedly.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the contract should implement the necessary security measures such as access control, input validation, proper handling of arithmetic operations, and protection against reentrancy attacks. Additionally, it should consider using secure randomness generation, preventing front-running attacks, and handling timestamps accurately.
