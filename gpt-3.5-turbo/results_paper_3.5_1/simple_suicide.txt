The provided smart contract is fairly simple and does not seem to have any of the specified vulnerabilities. However, there are a few minor issues that can be improved:

1. Line 6: The function name "sudicideAnyone" should be corrected to "suicideAnyone" for consistency and clarity.

2. Line 7: The `selfdestruct` function should include the keyword `public` to specify the visibility of the function.

Here is the updated version of the contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract SimpleSuicide {
  
  function suicideAnyone() public {
    selfdestruct(msg.sender);
  }

}
```

Please note that this version is free from the specified vulnerabilities, but it may still be susceptible to other vulnerabilities not mentioned in the initial list. It is always important to conduct a thorough security review and testing to ensure the contract is secure.
