The given smart contract does not have all the mentioned vulnerabilities, but it does have one vulnerability: Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls.

Here is the breakdown of the vulnerabilities and their presence in the given smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: Not present in the contract.
2. Access Control: Not present in the contract.
3. Arithmetic Issues: Not present in the contract.
4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: Present in the `callnotchecked` function. The function uses the `call` method without checking the return value, which can lead to unexpected behavior or failure if the called contract reverts.
5. Denial of Service: Not present in the contract.
6. Bad Randomness: Not present in the contract.
7. Front-Running: Not present in the contract.
8. Time Manipulation: Not present in the contract.
9. Short Address Attack: Not present in the contract.

To fix the Unchecked Return Values vulnerability in the `callnotchecked` function, you should check the return value of the `call` method and handle any possible failure or revert:

```solidity
function callnotchecked(address callee) public {
    require(callee.call(), "Call failed");
}
```

By adding the `require` statement, the contract will revert if the call fails, ensuring that the return value is checked and handled appropriately.
