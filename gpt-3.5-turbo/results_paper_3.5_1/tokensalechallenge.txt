After analyzing the given smart contract, here is a list of vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls, so the reentrancy vulnerability is not present.

2. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism implemented in this contract, meaning anyone can execute the functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations, so there is no possibility of integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not use any low-level calls, so this vulnerability is not present.

5. Denial of Service: There are no scenarios in the contract that could lead to a denial of service attack.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any random number generation, so this vulnerability is not applicable.

7. Front-Running: There are no scenarios in the contract that could lead to front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on any timestamps, so time manipulation vulnerability is not present.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not contain any code that could be exploited through off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, this contract appears to be relatively secure and does not seem to contain any of the mentioned vulnerabilities.
