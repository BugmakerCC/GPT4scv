After analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not contain any specific code that allows for reentrancy attacks. However, it is important to note that the vulnerability may still exist if other functions in the contract interact with external contracts that could potentially trigger recursive calls.

2. Access Control: The contract implements a basic access control mechanism through the "onlyowner" modifier. However, the "changeOwner" function does not include this modifier, which allows anyone to call the function and change the owner of the contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the provided contract, so there is no direct vulnerability related to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls to external contracts, so there is no direct vulnerability related to unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not contain any code that could lead to denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness, so there is no direct vulnerability related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not include any code that could lead to front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps, so there is no direct vulnerability related to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not involve any off-chain interactions or low-level operations that could be susceptible to short address attacks.

Overall, the main vulnerability in the provided contract is the lack of access control in the "changeOwner" function. To fix this vulnerability, the function should include the "onlyowner" modifier to ensure that only the contract owner can change the owner address.
