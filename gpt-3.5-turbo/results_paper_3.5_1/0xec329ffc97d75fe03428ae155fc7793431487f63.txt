Here are the vulnerabilities I have detected in the provided smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The `execute` function uses `call` to invoke another contract without checking for reentrant calls. This can allow an attacker to repeatedly call the `execute` function and drain the contract's funds.

2. Access Control: The `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict certain functions to be called only by the contract owner. However, it is not used consistently throughout the contract, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit checks for integer overflow or underflow in the contract. This can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `execute` function uses `call` to invoke another contract, but it does not check the return value of the call. This can result in silent failing sends, where the contract does not handle failures properly.

5. Denial of Service: The `run` function does not have any gas limit checks, which can lead to out-of-gas errors if the number of transfers is large. Additionally, the `fill` function does not have any checks to prevent multiple calls, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no random number generation functions in the contract, which can be a security issue if random numbers are required for any critical functionality.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any protections against front-running attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the order of transactions to gain an unfair advantage.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not have any protections against timestamp manipulation, which can be used by an attacker to abuse time-dependent functionality.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any checks to prevent short address attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the input data to exploit client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract should be audited and appropriate security measures should be implemented to address these vulnerabilities.
