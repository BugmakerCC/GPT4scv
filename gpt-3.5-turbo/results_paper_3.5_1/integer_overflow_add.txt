Upon analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the identified vulnerabilities:

1. Integer Overflow: The `run` function performs an addition operation (`count += input`) without checking for potential overflow. If the `input` value is large enough to cause the `count` variable to exceed its maximum value, an integer overflow vulnerability will occur.

To address this vulnerability, you can add a check to ensure that the addition operation does not result in an overflow. One approach is to use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations that prevent overflows and underflows.

To fix the vulnerability, you can modify the contract as follows:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.19;
import "github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v3.4.0/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol";

contract IntegerOverflowAdd {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    uint public count = 1;

    function run(uint256 input) public {
        count = count.add(input);
    }
}
```

By using the `SafeMath` library's `add` function, you can prevent integer overflows by reverting the transaction if an overflow would occur.

Please note that it's essential to verify the source and correctness of the imported `SafeMath.sol` file to ensure its security.
