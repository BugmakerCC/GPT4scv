Upon reviewing the smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdrawReward` function is susceptible to reentrancy attacks. After transferring the reward to the recipient, it immediately calls the `recipient.call` function. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `withdrawReward` function repeatedly before the transfer is completed, allowing them to drain the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: There are no access control mechanisms in place. Any address can call the `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` and `withdrawReward` functions, potentially causing unauthorized access and manipulation of rewards.

To address these vulnerabilities, the following changes can be made:

1. Use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks. This involves performing all necessary checks and state updates before interacting with external contracts. In this case, the transfer of rewards should be the last step after all state changes.

2. Implement access control mechanisms to restrict the execution of certain functions to authorized addresses only. This can be achieved by using modifiers or require statements to validate the caller's identity or role.

Here's an updated version of the smart contract that addresses these vulnerabilities:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract Reentrancy_bonus{

    // INSECURE
    mapping (address => uint) private userBalances;
    mapping (address => bool) private claimedBonus;
    mapping (address => uint) private rewardsForA;
    mapping (address => bool) private allowedAddresses;

    modifier onlyAllowed() {
        require(allowedAddresses[msg.sender]);
        _;
    }

    function withdrawReward(address recipient) public onlyAllowed {
        uint amountToWithdraw = rewardsForA[recipient];
        rewardsForA[recipient] = 0;
        require(recipient.call.value(amountToWithdraw)(""));
    }

    function getFirstWithdrawalBonus(address recipient) public onlyAllowed {
        require(!claimedBonus[recipient]); // Each recipient should only be able to claim the bonus once

        rewardsForA[recipient] += 100;
        
        claimedBonus[recipient] = true;
        withdrawReward(recipient); // At this point, the caller will be able to execute getFirstWithdrawalBonus again.
    }

    function addAllowedAddress(address _address) public {
        allowedAddresses[_address] = true;
    }

    function removeAllowedAddress(address _address) public {
        allowedAddresses[_address] = false;
    }
}
```

In the updated version, the `onlyAllowed` modifier is added to restrict the execution of functions to addresses that have been explicitly granted permission through the `addAllowedAddress` function. Additionally, the order of operations in the `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` function is rearranged to prevent reentrancy attacks.
