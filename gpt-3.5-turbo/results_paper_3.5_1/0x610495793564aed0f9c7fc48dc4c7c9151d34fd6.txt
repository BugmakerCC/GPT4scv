Based on the provided smart contract, here is an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls that can lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities. The withdrawal function is safe as it transfers funds directly to the owner without any external calls.

2. Access Control: The contract has an onlyOwner modifier that restricts certain functions to be executed only by the contract owner. This helps in ensuring access control.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the contract. The deposit count is incremented without any arithmetic calculations involved.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: In the sendMoney function, the contract uses a low-level call to execute code in the _target address. However, it does not check the return value of this call, which can lead to issues if the called contract reverts or throws an exception.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit vulnerability related to gas limit reached, unexpected throw, or unexpected kill. However, there is a potential access control breach in the sendMoney function as it allows the contract owner to execute arbitrary code in the _target address.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any randomness-related functionality, so there is no vulnerability related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any functionality that can be exploited by front-running attacks. There are no time-dependent checks or race conditions.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any explicit timestamp dependence that can be manipulated by malicious actors.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any explicit vulnerabilities related to off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract seems to be relatively secure, with proper access control and no obvious vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to add proper return value checks in the sendMoney function to handle potential failures or exceptions in the external calls.
