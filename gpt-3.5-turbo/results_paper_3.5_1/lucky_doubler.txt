Here is an analysis of the vulnerabilities present in the given smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls or interactions with other contracts, so there is no direct vulnerability for reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the "onlyowner" modifier to restrict certain functions to be called only by the contract owner. However, there is no explicit access control mechanism implemented for user-specific operations.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the contract that could lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not have any low-level calls (e.g., using the "call" or "delegatecall" functions) where return values are not checked.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit denial-of-service vulnerabilities such as gas limit reached or unexpected throw. However, it is possible that the contract could become unresponsive if there are many pending unpaid entries and the balance is not sufficient to pay them.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses the blockhash of the previous block to generate random numbers. This approach is not secure as it can be manipulated by miners. It is recommended to use external sources of randomness, such as oracles.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any explicit vulnerabilities related to front-running.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any explicit dependencies on timestamps that could be manipulated.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any explicit vulnerabilities related to short address attacks.

Overall, the given smart contract does not have any major vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to improve the randomness generation and consider implementing access control mechanisms to enhance security.
