Based on the provided smart contract, let's analyze it for the common vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The smart contract does not have any external calls to other contracts, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The smart contract implements an "onlyOwner" modifier to restrict certain functions to the contract owner. This helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The smart contract does not perform any arithmetic operations, so it is not vulnerable to arithmetic issues like integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The smart contract does not make any low-level calls using the "call" function, so there are no unchecked return values to handle.

5. Denial of Service: The smart contract does not have any vulnerable code patterns that could lead to a denial of service attack.

6. Bad Randomness: The smart contract does not have any randomness-related functionality, so there are no vulnerabilities related to randomness.

7. Front-Running: The smart contract does not have any critical sections that could be front-run or race conditions that could be exploited.

8. Time Manipulation: The smart contract uses the "now" variable to store the current timestamp. However, there is no code that relies on the accuracy of this timestamp, so time manipulation is not a vulnerability in this case.

9. Short Address Attack: The smart contract does not have any functions that accept variable length arguments, so it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the provided smart contract does not contain any of the common vulnerabilities you mentioned. However, it is important to note that the analysis is based on the provided code snippet and may not cover all potential vulnerabilities. A comprehensive review of the entire contract would be required to ensure its security.
