Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided smart contract for the vulnerabilities mentioned:

1. Reentrancy:
The smart contract does not have any external contract calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control:
The contract uses the `Owner` variable to restrict certain functions to only be executed by the contract owner. However, the access control mechanism is not robust as it only checks for the `msg.sender` address. This can be easily manipulated if an attacker gains control of the contract owner's address.

3. Arithmetic Issues:
There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the contract, so there are no integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls:
The contract uses `address.call.value()` to execute a low-level call. It does not check the return value of the call, which means that if the called contract has a fallback function that reverts, the contract will not handle the failure and will continue execution.

5. Denial of Service:
The contract does not have any explicit vulnerabilities related to gas limit reached, unexpected throw, unexpected kill, or access control breaches.

6. Bad Randomness:
The contract does not generate or rely on any randomness, so this vulnerability is not present.

7. Front-Running:
The contract does not have any explicit vulnerabilities related to front-running or transaction ordering dependence.

8. Time Manipulation:
The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical functionality, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.

9. Short Address Attack:
The contract does not have any explicit vulnerabilities related to off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract is vulnerable to access control issues and unchecked return values for low-level calls. It is recommended to improve the access control mechanism by using a more robust authentication scheme and check the return values of low-level calls to handle potential failures.
