Here are the vulnerabilities found in the given smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The smart contract does not have any external contract calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The smart contract has an "onlyowner" modifier, which restricts certain functions to be called only by the owner. This is a basic form of access control, but it can still be improved by using a more secure access control mechanism.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The smart contract does not have any arithmetic operations, so it is not vulnerable to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The smart contract does not have any low-level calls, so it is not vulnerable to unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: The smart contract does not have any loops or conditions that could lead to a denial of service attack. The withdrawal function can only be called by the owner, preventing unauthorized withdrawals.

6. Bad Randomness: The smart contract does not involve any randomness, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The smart contract does not have any transactions that could be front-run.

8. Time Manipulation: The smart contract does not rely on the timestamp, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The smart contract does not have any off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities, so it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, this smart contract does not have any major vulnerabilities, but it can still be improved in terms of access control and security mechanisms.
