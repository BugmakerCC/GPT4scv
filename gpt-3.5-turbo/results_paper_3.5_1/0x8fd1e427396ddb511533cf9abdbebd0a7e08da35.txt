Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external contract calls that could potentially lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities.

2. Access Control: The contract implements an "onlyOwner" modifier to restrict certain functions to the contract owner.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not have any explicit arithmetic operations that could result in integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses a low-level call to transfer tokens in the "WithdrawToken" function. It does not check the return value of the call, which could potentially result in a failure to transfer tokens if the called contract does not implement the transfer function correctly.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit vulnerabilities that could lead to denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any randomness-related functionality.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any explicit vulnerabilities that could lead to front-running attacks.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not have any explicit time-related functionality.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any explicit vulnerabilities related to off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the smart contract does not appear to have any significant vulnerabilities based on the provided analysis. However, it is important to note that this analysis is based on the provided code snippet and may not cover all possible vulnerabilities. A thorough security audit is recommended before deploying the contract in a production environment.
