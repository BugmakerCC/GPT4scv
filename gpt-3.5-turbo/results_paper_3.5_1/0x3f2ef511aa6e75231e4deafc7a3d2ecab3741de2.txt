Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls or interactions that can be exploited for reentrancy attacks. 

2. Access Control: The contract uses a simple access control mechanism where the owner can withdraw funds. However, there are no explicit restrictions on who can call the redeem() function.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could result in integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls that require checking return values.

5. Denial of Service: There are no gas limit-related vulnerabilities or unexpected throw or kill statements in the contract. However, the access control in the withdraw() function can be easily bypassed by setting the sender address to the owner's address.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any randomness-related functions.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any critical functions that can be exploited for front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps or time-dependent conditions.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract does not seem to have any major vulnerabilities. However, it lacks proper access control in the redeem() function and withdraw() function, which can be exploited by an attacker.
