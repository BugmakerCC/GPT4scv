Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, here is an analysis of the vulnerabilities present:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls, so this vulnerability is not present.

5. Denial of Service: The `insertNnumbers` function can be used to consume a large amount of gas if the `numbers` parameter is set to a value greater than the gas limit. This can potentially lead to a denial of service attack.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any vulnerable areas related to front-running.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps or time-related functionality, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract is vulnerable to access control issues and denial of service attacks. It is recommended to implement access control mechanisms and limit gas consumption in the `insertNnumbers` function.
