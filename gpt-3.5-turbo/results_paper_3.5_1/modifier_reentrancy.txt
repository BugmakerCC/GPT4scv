After analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: The smart contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks. In the `attack` contract, the `supportsToken` function can be called multiple times within a single transaction, allowing an attacker to repeatedly call the `airDrop` function and drain the contract's token balance.

2. Access Control: The `supportsToken` modifier in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract relies on the implementation of the `Bank` contract to verify the token support. However, there is no access control mechanism in place to prevent unauthorized calls to the `supportsToken` function in the `Bank` contract.

3. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: In the `attack` contract, the `call` function calls the `airDrop` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract without checking the return value. This can lead to silent failures if the `airDrop` function encounters an error.

To fix these vulnerabilities, the following changes are recommended:

1. Reentrancy vulnerability can be mitigated by implementing the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Here's an example of how it can be applied in the `airDrop` function:

```solidity
function airDrop() hasNoBalance supportsToken public {
  uint balance = tokenBalance[msg.sender];
  tokenBalance[msg.sender] = 0;
  // Perform state changes before interacting with external contracts
  if (balance > 0) {
    require(msg.sender.call.value(balance)());
  }
}
```

2. Access control vulnerability can be addressed by adding a modifier or function to validate the caller's authorization before executing sensitive operations. This can be done by implementing a whitelist of authorized addresses that can call the `supportsToken` function.

3. To address the unchecked return value vulnerability, the `call` function in the `attack` contract should include a check and handling for the return value of the `airDrop` function call.

It is crucial to note that the provided code may contain additional vulnerabilities not mentioned in the initial list. A comprehensive security audit is recommended to ensure the smart contract's robustness and protection against potential vulnerabilities.
