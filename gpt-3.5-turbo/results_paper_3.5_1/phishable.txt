Here is an analysis of the given smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external function calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the `require` statement to check if the `tx.origin` is equal to the owner. This is not a recommended way to implement access control as it is susceptible to certain attacks like the "Delegatecall to Untrusted Callee" attack. It is better to use the `msg.sender` instead of `tx.origin` for access control.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract, so it is not vulnerable to arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls, so it is not vulnerable to unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit gas limit checks or operations that can lead to denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any randomness-related functions, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any critical operations that can be front-run, so it is not vulnerable to front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any timestamp-related operations, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any function that accepts variable length arguments, so it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the given smart contract is relatively secure against the mentioned vulnerabilities. However, it is still recommended to review and test the contract thoroughly in different scenarios to ensure its security.
