Here is an analysis of the smart contract provided for the common vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have a vulnerable external call. It does not make any external calls to other contracts or use any recursive calls, so reentrancy vulnerability is not present.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any explicit access control mechanisms in place. Anyone can call the `sendToWinner` and `withdrawLeftOver` functions. This could potentially be a vulnerability if only specific users should be allowed to call these functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not involve any arithmetic operations, so there is no vulnerability related to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses the `send` function to transfer funds, but it does not check the return value to handle any failure in the transfer. This can lead to a silent failure if the transfer fails. It is recommended to use the `transfer` function or check the return value of `send` to handle any failure.

5. Denial of Service: There are no explicit denial of service vulnerabilities in the contract. However, the contract relies on external calls (`send`) to transfer funds, which can consume a significant amount of gas. This could potentially lead to a gas limit reached issue if the contract balance is too large.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any randomness-related functionality, so this vulnerability does not apply.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not involve any critical transaction ordering or timing-dependent operations, so front-running vulnerability is not present.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not depend on timestamps for any critical functionality, so time manipulation vulnerability is not present.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any external function parameters that could be exploited for short address attack.

Overall, the contract does not exhibit most of the common vulnerabilities you mentioned. However, there are some improvements that can be made to handle return values for low-level calls and add access control mechanisms if required.
