Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not contain any external function calls that could potentially lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities.

2. Access Control: The contract does not implement any explicit access control mechanisms. This means that anyone can call the `withdrawTokens` and `withdrawEther` functions, potentially leading to unauthorized access and funds being withdrawn.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract that could result in integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract calls the `call` function on `addr` without checking the return value. This could potentially lead to silent failing sends, allowing an attacker to execute malicious code without proper error handling.

5. Denial of Service: There are no specific denial of service vulnerabilities present in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness generation or usage.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not contain any sensitive operations that could be front-run.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical operations.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract is susceptible to access control issues and unchecked return values for low-level calls. It is recommended to implement access control mechanisms and properly handle return values to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
