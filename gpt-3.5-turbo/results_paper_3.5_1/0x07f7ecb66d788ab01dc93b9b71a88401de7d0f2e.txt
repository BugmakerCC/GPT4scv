Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the vulnerabilities mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not seem to have any external contract calls that could potentially allow reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the onlyOwner modifier to restrict certain functions to the contract owner. This is a good practice to limit access to sensitive operations.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not have any arithmetic operations that could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low Level Calls: The contract does not have any low-level calls that require checking return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit reached or unexpected behaviors that could lead to a denial of service.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses the blockhash function to generate random numbers. This is not a secure source of randomness as miners can manipulate the blockhash. It is recommended to use an external source of randomness for secure random number generation.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not seem to have any vulnerabilities related to front-running.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not seem to have any vulnerabilities related to timestamp manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain issues or vulnerabilities related to client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract seems to be free from most of the common vulnerabilities. However, there are some improvements that can be made, such as using a secure source of randomness and adding more comprehensive input validation.
