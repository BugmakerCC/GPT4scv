The given smart contract does not contain all of the vulnerabilities mentioned. However, it does contain an incorrect constructor name, which is a vulnerability known as SWC-118.

In the contract, the constructor function is named "Constructor" instead of using the correct constructor syntax, which is the same name as the contract itself. This can cause issues when deploying or interacting with the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you should rename the function "Constructor" to the name of the contract "Missing".

Here is the updated smart contract with the correct constructor name:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Missing {
    address private owner;

    modifier onlyowner {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function () payable {}

    function withdraw() public onlyowner {
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```

Make sure to always follow the correct naming conventions for the constructor function to avoid potential issues.
