The smart contract provided is the Rubixi contract. Let's analyze it for the common vulnerabilities you mentioned.

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls to other contracts, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract has an "onlyowner" modifier that restricts certain functions to be only called by the creator of the contract. This provides basic access control.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that can lead to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The contract does not use low-level calls (e.g., `call.value()()`) without checking the return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any vulnerabilities related to gas limit reached, unexpected throw, unexpected kill, or breached access control.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any random number generation, so there is no vulnerability related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any vulnerable points related to front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not use timestamps for critical decision-making, so there is no vulnerability related to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any external function calls that could be vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the Rubixi contract does not seem to have any of the common vulnerabilities you mentioned. However, it is important to note that this analysis is based on the provided code snippet, and a more thorough analysis would require reviewing the entire context and dependencies of the contract.
