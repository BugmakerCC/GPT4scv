Here are the vulnerabilities found in the provided smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any specific code that allows reentrant calls, but it is always a good practice to review all external function calls and ensure they are not susceptible to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place, which means anyone can call the functions and perform actions that may not be intended for them.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract performs arithmetic operations, but it does not have any checks for potential integer overflow or underflow issues. This can lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses low-level calls to transfer funds, but it does not check the return values of these calls. This can lead to silent failures and vulnerabilities.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit checks or protection against unexpected throw or kill calls. This can make the contract vulnerable to denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses blockhash as a source of randomness, which is not a secure method for generating random numbers. This can be exploited by attackers to predict outcomes, leading to unfair gameplay.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any protection against front-running attacks, where attackers can manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses block.timestamp for time-related operations, which can be manipulated by miners. This can lead to vulnerabilities in time-dependent functionalities.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any checks for the length of input addresses, which can make it vulnerable to short address attacks.

It is important to note that these vulnerabilities are identified based on the provided code. A thorough security audit is recommended to evaluate the contract for all possible vulnerabilities.
