Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls, so reentrancy is not a concern.

2. Access Control: The contract has a modifier `onlywizard` which restricts certain functions to be called only by the wizard. This ensures that only the wizard can perform certain actions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract that could lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses the `send` function to transfer funds to addresses. However, it does not check the return value of the `send` function, which could lead to loss of funds if the transfer fails. This can be considered a vulnerability.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any specific checks or mechanisms to prevent denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not rely on random numbers or randomness, so this vulnerability is not applicable.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any specific checks or mechanisms to prevent front-running attacks.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses `block.timestamp` to record the start time of the monarch's rule. However, it does not have any checks or mechanisms to prevent manipulation of the timestamp, which could potentially be a vulnerability.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract seems to have addressed some of the vulnerabilities, but there are still a few areas that could be improved to enhance security.
