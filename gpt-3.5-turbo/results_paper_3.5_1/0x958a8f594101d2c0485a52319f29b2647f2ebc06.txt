After reviewing the smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that I found:

1. Reentrancy: The `execute` function allows the owner to call another contract's function, which can be exploited if the called contract's function performs an external call back to the `Marriage` contract before completing execution.

2. Access Control: The `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict certain functions to be called only by the owner. However, there is no check to ensure that the `changeOwner` and `acceptOwnership` functions are not called by unauthorized parties.

3. Arithmetic Issues: No arithmetic operations are present in the contract, so there is no vulnerability related to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `execute` function performs a low-level call to another contract without checking the return value. This can lead to silent failures where the called contract's function reverts but the `execute` function continues execution.

5. Denial of Service: There are no explicit vulnerabilities related to denial of service attacks in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no random number generation functions in the contract, so there is no vulnerability related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: There are no specific vulnerabilities related to front-running in the contract.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses the `now` keyword to get the current timestamp, which can be manipulated by miners to some extent. This can affect the ordering of events or the validity of certain time-dependent conditions.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any payable functions that accept external calls, so there is no vulnerability related to short address attacks in this contract.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided smart contract code and does not take into account any potential vulnerabilities or security issues in the dependencies or implementations of the functions called within the contract. It is always recommended to conduct a thorough security review by experienced auditors to ensure the contract's safety.
