Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, the Reentrance contract, I have identified the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability occurs when a contract's function can be called multiple times before its execution completes. It allows an attacker to repeatedly call the function and drain the contract's balance. In this contract, the `withdraw` function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the contract to be called recursively before the `balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;` statement reduces the sender's balance.

2. Access Control: This vulnerability refers to the lack of proper access restrictions on functions. In the given contract, all functions are public, meaning anyone can call them. This may lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of contract state.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not explicitly handle integer overflow and underflow issues. If the `balances[_to] += msg.value;` or `balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;` statements cause an overflow or underflow, it could lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses a low-level `call` function without checking its return value. If the called contract has a fallback function that throws an exception, the `if(msg.sender.call.value(_amount)())` statement will silently fail, leading to potential loss of funds.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the contract should be audited and updated accordingly.
