This smart contract is vulnerable to the Reentrancy vulnerability. The vulnerability occurs in the `withdrawAll` function. Here is the step-by-step analysis of the vulnerability:

1. The `withdrawAll` function is called by a user to withdraw their entire credit balance.
2. The function first checks if the user has any credit (`oCredit > 0`).
3. If the user has credit, the function subtracts the credit from the contract's balance (`balance -= oCredit`).
4. Then, the function calls the `call` function on the `msg.sender` address with the value of `oCredit`.
5. The `call` function allows the recipient to execute code in their contract. In this case, the recipient is the same contract (`msg.sender`) which means the `withdrawAll` function can be called again before it completes.
6. This creates a recursive call vulnerability where an attacker can repeatedly call the `withdrawAll` function, draining the contract's balance multiple times before the balance is updated.
7. After the `call` function, the function sets the user's credit to 0 (`credit[msg.sender] = 0`).

To fix this vulnerability, the `withdrawAll` function should update the user's credit balance before executing the external call. This ensures that the balance is not drained multiple times in a recursive call scenario. The updated code should look like this:

```
function withdrawAll() public {
    uint oCredit = credit[msg.sender];
    if (oCredit > 0) {
        credit[msg.sender] = 0;
        balance -= oCredit;

        bool callResult = msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)();
        require(callResult);
    }
}
```

By moving the `credit[msg.sender] = 0` line before the external call, the vulnerability is mitigated as the user's credit balance is updated first, preventing reentrancy attacks.
