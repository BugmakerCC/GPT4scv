Here is an analysis of the given smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external function calls or interactions with other contracts, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract uses a simple access control mechanism by checking if `tx.origin` is equal to the `owner` address. This is not the recommended way to implement access control, as `tx.origin` can be manipulated in certain situations. It is advised to use `msg.sender` instead.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations, so it is not vulnerable to arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls using `call()` or `delegatecall()`, so it is not vulnerable to unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit-related vulnerabilities or potential denial of service issues.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any sensitive functions that could be front-run.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on the timestamp or block number for any critical functionality, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any functions that accept variable-length data, so it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the given smart contract does not have any major vulnerabilities based on the mentioned vulnerabilities. However, the access control mechanism can be improved by using `msg.sender` instead of `tx.origin`.
