After analyzing the provided smart contract, I have identified several vulnerabilities. Let's go through each vulnerability one by one:

1. Reentrancy: The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attack. In the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`, the external contract is called before updating the balance. An attacker can exploit this by creating a malicious contract that reverts the transfer and repeatedly calls the `CashOut` function, draining the balance.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms. Anyone can call the `Deposit` and `CashOut` functions, potentially leading to unauthorized access and manipulation of balances.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not have explicit checks for integer overflow and underflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior and loss of funds if large amounts are deposited or withdrawn.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The contract does not check the return value of the low-level call in the `CashOut` function. If the call fails, the balance will still be deducted, leading to loss of funds.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit check or control. An attacker can perform a denial of service attack by sending a large amount of gas to the `CashOut` function, which may cause the transaction to run out of gas and fail.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have a secure source of randomness. This can be exploited by an attacker to predict outcomes or manipulate the contract's behavior.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any mechanisms to prevent front-running attacks. An attacker can monitor pending transactions and execute their own transaction with higher gas fees to manipulate the contract's behavior.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses the `now` keyword to get the current timestamp. This can be manipulated by miners to influence the behavior of the contract.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract is not vulnerable to the short address attack as it does not have any function that relies on the length of the input data.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the contract should be updated as follows:

- Implement a proper access control mechanism to restrict the usage of functions to authorized users.
- Use safe arithmetic libraries or include explicit checks for integer overflow and underflow.
- Check the return value of low-level calls and handle failures appropriately.
- Implement gas limit checks and control to prevent denial of service attacks.
- Use a secure source of randomness for any random number generation.
- Use mechanisms to prevent front-running attacks, such as using commit-reveal schemes.
- Avoid relying on `now` for critical time-dependent operations and consider using block timestamps instead.
- Ensure that function inputs are properly validated and parsed to prevent any potential off-chain vulnerabilities.

Note: This list of vulnerabilities and recommended mitigations is not exhaustive. It is always recommended to have a security audit performed by professionals to ensure the contract's security.
