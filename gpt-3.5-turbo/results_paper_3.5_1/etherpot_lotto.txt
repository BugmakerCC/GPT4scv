Here are the vulnerabilities found in the given smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any code that calls external contracts. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms. This means that anyone can call the functions and potentially manipulate the state of the contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that can lead to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls to other contracts, so there are no unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit reached vulnerabilities, unexpected throws, unexpected kills, or access control breaches.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses the blockhash of a specific block to calculate the winner, which is not a secure way to generate random numbers. An attacker could potentially manipulate the blockhash to their advantage.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any time-of-check vs time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities, race conditions, or transaction ordering dependence.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical functionality, so time manipulation is not a vulnerability.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract is relatively secure, but it does have vulnerabilities related to access control and randomness generation. It is recommended to add access control mechanisms and use a more secure source of randomness for the winner calculation.
