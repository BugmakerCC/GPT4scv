After reviewing the smart contract provided, here is an analysis of the vulnerabilities present:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not contain any explicit code that allows reentrancy attacks.
2. Access Control: The contract uses a basic access control mechanism by only allowing the owner to perform certain actions.
3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract uses the SafeMath library to prevent integer overflow and underflow.
4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The contract calls external contracts using the `call` function without checking the return values, which can lead to silent failures.
5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any specific protections against denial-of-service attacks.
6. Bad Randomness: There is no randomness used in the contract, so this vulnerability is not applicable.
7. Front-Running: The contract does not contain any critical operations that could be exploited through front-running attacks.
8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for critical operations, so this vulnerability is not applicable.
9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the contract seems to have some vulnerabilities related to unchecked return values for low-level calls, but it does not appear to have any critical vulnerabilities like reentrancy or access control issues. However, further analysis might be required to identify any additional vulnerabilities or edge cases.
