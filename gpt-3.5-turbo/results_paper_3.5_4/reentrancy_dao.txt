The provided smart contract is susceptible to the Reentrancy vulnerability.

Reentrancy vulnerability occurs when an external contract is called within the current contract without properly handling the execution flow. In this case, the `withdrawAll()` function allows the user to withdraw their entire credit balance. However, it does not protect against reentrancy attacks.

An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `withdrawAll()` function repeatedly before the balance is updated, allowing them to drain the contract's balance.

To fix this vulnerability, you should consider using the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern. This pattern involves performing all necessary checks and updates before interacting with external contracts.

Here's an updated version of the smart contract with the fix:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.19;

contract ReentrancyDAO {
    mapping (address => uint) credit;
    uint balance;

    function withdrawAll() public {
        uint oCredit = credit[msg.sender];
        if (oCredit > 0) {
            credit[msg.sender] = 0;
            balance -= oCredit;

            bool callResult = msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)();
            require(callResult);
        }
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        credit[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        balance += msg.value;
    }
}
```

In the updated version, the contract first updates the credit balance and then subtracts the credit from the contract's balance. This ensures that the attacker cannot repeatedly call the `withdrawAll()` function and drain the contract's balance.
