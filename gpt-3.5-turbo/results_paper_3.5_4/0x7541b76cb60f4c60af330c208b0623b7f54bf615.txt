After analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be found:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not implement any protection mechanism to prevent reentrancy attacks. In the `Collect` function, the contract balance is updated after the external call to `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. An attacker could potentially call this function recursively before the balance is updated, allowing them to drain the contract's funds.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms to restrict function calls. This means that anyone can call the `Put` and `Collect` functions, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not handle arithmetic issues such as integer overflow and underflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities in the contract's logic.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The contract does not check the return value of the low-level call in the `Collect` function. If the external call fails, the contract does not handle this situation and continues execution, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit checks or safeguards against unexpected throws. This can potentially lead to denial of service attacks where an attacker can force the contract to consume excessive gas or throw unexpected exceptions.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not implement any secure randomness generation mechanism, making it vulnerable to predictability attacks.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not mitigate front-running vulnerabilities, where an attacker can manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract relies on the `now` variable for time-based operations. This can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to exploit time-based vulnerabilities.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not implement checks for short addresses, which can be exploited in off-chain interactions and result in unexpected behavior.

To improve the security of the smart contract, the following steps can be taken:

- Implement a reentrancy guard using the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- Add access control mechanisms to restrict function calls to authorized users only.
- Implement proper checks and safeguards to handle arithmetic issues, including integer overflow and underflow.
- Check the return value of low-level calls and handle potential failures appropriately.
- Implement gas limit checks and handle unexpected throws to prevent denial of service attacks.
- Use a secure randomness generation mechanism, such as using an external oracle or a commit-reveal scheme.
- Implement measures to mitigate front-running, such as using cryptographic techniques or using pre-committed values.
- Avoid relying solely on `now` for time-based operations and consider using block timestamps or external time oracles.
- Implement checks for short addresses to prevent off-chain vulnerabilities.

These are some of the steps that can be taken to address the vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract. However, it is still advisable to conduct a thorough security audit and testing to ensure the contract's robustness.
