Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy Vulnerability: This vulnerability occurs when an external contract called by the smart contract can call back into the contract before the initial call is completed. In this contract, the `sendMoney` function could potentially be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. When `_target.call.value(_value)(_data)` is executed, it allows the receiving contract to call back into the `SimpleWallet` contract before the transfer is completed.

2. Access Control Vulnerability: The `onlyOwner` modifier is used in the `withdrawAll`, `withdraw`, and `sendMoney` functions to restrict access to the owner only. However, there is no mechanism in place to change the owner address after contract deployment. This means that the contract owner cannot be changed, leaving the contract vulnerable if the owner's private key is compromised.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not involve any arithmetic operations, so there are no vulnerabilities related to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The `sendMoney` function uses a low-level call to another contract without checking the return value. This can result in silent failures if the called contract reverts or throws an exception.

5. Denial of Service Vulnerability: There are no specific vulnerabilities related to denial of service attacks in this contract.

6. Bad Randomness Vulnerability: The contract does not involve any random number generation, so there are no vulnerabilities related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running Vulnerability: The contract does not involve any sensitive state changes that could be front-run by miners or other participants.

8. Time Manipulation Vulnerability: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical functionality, so there are no vulnerabilities related to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not involve any off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities, so there are no vulnerabilities related to short address attacks.

To summarize, the vulnerabilities identified in the provided smart contract are Reentrancy Vulnerability and Access Control Vulnerability.
