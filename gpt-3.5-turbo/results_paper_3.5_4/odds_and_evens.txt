Based on the code provided, here is an analysis for each vulnerability:

1. Reentrancy: The code does not have any external calls that could lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities.

2. Access Control: There is no explicit access control mechanism in the code. The function `getProfit()` restricts access to the owner, but it does not prevent other functions from being called by unauthorized parties.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic calculations in the code that could lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The code includes two `send` calls, but it properly checks the return values and assigns them to the variable `res`.

5. Denial of Service: The code does not have any explicit denial of service vulnerabilities.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no random number generation or usage in the code, so there are no bad randomness vulnerabilities.

7. Front-Running: The code does not include any sensitive operations that could be front-run.

8. Time Manipulation: The code does not rely on timestamps for any critical operations, so there are no time manipulation vulnerabilities.

9. Short Address Attack: The code does not have any off-chain interactions or rely on client inputs, so there are no short address attack vulnerabilities.

Overall, the code appears to be relatively safe from the common vulnerabilities mentioned. However, it lacks access control mechanisms, which could potentially allow unauthorized access to certain functions.
