After carefully reviewing the smart contract provided, I have identified several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` statement can be called multiple times before the `acc.balance-=_am;` line is executed, allowing an attacker to repeatedly execute the `Collect` function and drain the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: There are no access control mechanisms in place to restrict who can call the `Put`, `Collect`, and other functions. This means anyone can interact with the contract and potentially manipulate its state.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` statement in the `Collect` function does not check the return value. If the call fails, the contract does not handle the failure and continues execution, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

4. Denial of Service: There are no gas limit checks in the `Put` function, allowing an attacker to exploit the contract by sending a large amount of gas and causing the function to run out of gas.

5. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any mechanism to generate random numbers, which can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the contract's behavior.

6. Front-Running: There are no measures in place to prevent front-running attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage.

7. Time Manipulation: The contract uses the `now` keyword to check the current timestamp, which can be manipulated by miners to affect the contract's logic.

8. Short Address Attack: The contract does not check for short address attacks, which can be used to exploit the contract by passing in a shorter address than expected.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the contract should be updated to include proper access control mechanisms, handle return values for low-level calls, implement gas limit checks, use secure random number generation, prevent front-running attacks, protect against time manipulation, and validate address lengths to guard against short address attacks.
