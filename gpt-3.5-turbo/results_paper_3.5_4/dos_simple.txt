Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that I have identified:

1. Denial of Service (DoS): The `ifillArray` function allows an attacker to repeatedly call the function and fill the `listAddresses` array. If the array length is less than 1500, the function adds 350 addresses to the array. An attacker can continuously call this function, causing the array to grow in size and potentially consuming all available gas, resulting in a denial of service.

2. Gas Limit Reached: As part of the DoS vulnerability, if the `listAddresses` array grows to a very large size, the gas required to execute the function may exceed the block gas limit, leading to a failed transaction.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, you can consider implementing the following changes:

1. Implement a limit on the number of times the `ifillArray` function can be called, or limit the number of addresses that can be added in a single call to prevent excessive growth of the `listAddresses` array.

2. Consider using a dynamic array instead of a fixed-size array. This way, the array can grow when needed, without the risk of exceeding the gas limit.

3. Add appropriate access control mechanisms to restrict who can call the `ifillArray` function to prevent unauthorized users from triggering the DoS vulnerability.

4. Use gas-efficient coding practices and optimize the contract to minimize gas consumption.

Please note that these are just general suggestions, and further analysis may be required based on the specific requirements and context of the smart contract.
