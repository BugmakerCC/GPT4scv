After reviewing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities present:

1. Reentrancy: The `CashOut` function allows the contract owner to withdraw funds by calling `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This can lead to reentrancy attacks if the called contract performs operations that can trigger the `CashOut` function again before the first execution completes.

2. Access Control: There are no access control mechanisms in place to restrict who can call the `Deposit` and `CashOut` functions. Any address can deposit and withdraw funds.

3. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: After calling `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`, the contract does not check the return value of the call. This can lead to silent failure if the called contract reverts or throws an exception.

4. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit checks, allowing an attacker to potentially drain all the available gas by calling the functions with excessive gas.

5. Bad Randomness: There is no mechanism in the contract to generate secure random numbers. This can lead to predictability and manipulation of outcomes in functions that rely on randomness.

6. Front-Running: The contract does not implement any measures to prevent front-running attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage.

7. Time Manipulation: The contract uses the `now` keyword to get the current timestamp, which can be manipulated by miners to exploit time-dependent conditions.

8. Short Address Attack: The contract does not perform proper input validation, which can lead to a potential short address attack where an attacker can pass a shorter input to the `CashOut` function, causing unexpected behavior.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, it is recommended to implement the following security measures:

1. Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.
2. Implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can call certain functions.
3. Check the return value of low-level calls and handle any failures gracefully.
4. Implement gas limit checks to prevent denial of service attacks.
5. Use a secure source of randomness for any operations that require randomness.
6. Implement measures to prevent front-running attacks, such as using commit-reveal schemes or other mechanisms.
7. Avoid relying on timestamps for critical operations and consider using block numbers instead.
8. Perform proper input validation to prevent short address attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.

By addressing these vulnerabilities, the smart contract can be made more secure.
