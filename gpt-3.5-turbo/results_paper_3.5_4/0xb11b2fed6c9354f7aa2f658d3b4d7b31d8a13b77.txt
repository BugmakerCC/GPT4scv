Based on the provided smart contract, here is an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: There doesn't seem to be any direct reentrancy vulnerability in this contract. The `withdraw` function is properly checking the deposit balance before transferring funds.

2. Access Control: The `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict certain functions to be callable only by the contract owner. However, there is a duplicate declaration of the `Owner` variable in the `DepositProxy` contract which may cause confusion and potential access control issues.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in this contract, so there is no direct vulnerability related to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `proxy` function uses the `call` function to execute a low-level call to the `target` contract. However, it doesn't check the return value of the `call` function, which could lead to silent failure if the target contract reverts. It is recommended to handle the return value to ensure proper execution.

5. Denial of Service: There are no apparent denial of service vulnerabilities in this contract.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no random number generation mechanisms in this contract, so there is no vulnerability related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: There doesn't seem to be any explicit front-running vulnerability in this contract.

8. Time Manipulation: There are no explicit dependencies on block timestamps in this contract, so there is no vulnerability related to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: There are no off-chain interactions or client-facing vulnerabilities in this contract, so there is no vulnerability related to short address attacks.

Overall, the main vulnerabilities to consider in this contract are the access control issue with duplicate `Owner` declaration and the lack of checking the return value for low-level calls in the `proxy` function.
