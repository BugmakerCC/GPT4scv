Here are the vulnerabilities found in the provided smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The `join` function calls `send` to transfer funds to the user's address. This can potentially allow an attacker to re-enter the contract and exploit the transfer function.
2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place, allowing anyone to call the functions and modify contract state.
3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not handle integer overflow and underflow in the calculations for deposit and payout amounts, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses `send` to transfer funds to user addresses without checking the return value, which can lead to silent failing sends.
5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit checks, allowing an attacker to consume all available gas and prevent other transactions from being executed.
6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses blockhash to generate random numbers, which is not a reliable source of randomness and can be manipulated by miners.
7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any mechanisms to prevent front-running attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage.
8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any mechanisms to prevent manipulation of the timestamp, which can be used to exploit time-based conditions.
9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not check the length of addresses, which can be exploited by attackers to steal funds.

To fix these vulnerabilities, the contract should implement the following measures:

1. Use the `transfer` function instead of `send` to transfer funds, as it includes a gas stipend and prevents reentrancy attacks.
2. Implement access control mechanisms such as only allowing the contract owner to modify certain functions or using a role-based access control system.
3. Add checks for integer overflow and underflow when performing calculations involving deposit and payout amounts.
4. Check the return value of low-level calls to ensure that the transfer was successful.
5. Implement gas limit checks to prevent denial of service attacks.
6. Use a more secure source of randomness, such as an oracle or an external random number generator.
7. Implement mechanisms to prevent front-running attacks, such as using commit-reveal schemes or using cryptographic functions for order-dependent operations.
8. Use block.timestamp instead of block.number to prevent manipulation of the timestamp.
9. Validate the length of addresses to prevent short address attacks.

Please note that these are general recommendations and the actual fixes may require more detailed analysis and modifications to the contract's logic.
