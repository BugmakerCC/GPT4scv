Here are the vulnerabilities that can be found in the given smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any code that allows for reentrant calls, so this vulnerability is not present.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the "onlyOwner" modifier to restrict access to certain functions, which is a good practice.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract, so this vulnerability is not present.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses the "call" function to transfer tokens, but it does not check the return value of the call. This can result in silent failing sends and should be addressed.

5. Denial of Service: There are no gas limit issues, unexpected throws, or unexpected kills in the contract. However, the access control can be breached if an unauthorized user gains access to the owner's account.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no random number generation functions in the contract, so this vulnerability is not present.

7. Front-Running: There are no time-of-check vs time-of-use (TOCTOU) or transaction ordering dependence (TOD) issues in the contract, so this vulnerability is not present.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical functionality, so this vulnerability is not present.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities, so this vulnerability is not present.

Overall, the contract has some vulnerabilities related to unchecked return values for low level calls and potential access control breaches. These issues should be addressed to improve the security of the contract.
