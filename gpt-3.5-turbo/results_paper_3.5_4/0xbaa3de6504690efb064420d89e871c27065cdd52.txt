Here is the analysis of the smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls that could lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict certain functions to be called only by the owner.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the contract that could lead to arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `proxy` function makes a low-level call to the `target` contract without checking the return value. This could potentially lead to silent failing sends if the target contract has a fallback function that reverts the call.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit denial of service vulnerabilities.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any explicit front-running vulnerabilities.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any explicit timestamp manipulation vulnerabilities.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any explicit short address attack vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract does not have any severe vulnerabilities, but it could be improved by adding checks for the return value of the low-level call in the `proxy` function.
