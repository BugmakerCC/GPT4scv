Upon analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not contain any external function calls that can be exploited for reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract uses a modifier "onlyowner" to restrict certain functions to be called only by the contract creator. However, the modifier is not used in any function, so there is no proper access control mechanism present.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that can lead to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not make low-level calls, so there are no unchecked return values to handle.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit denial of service vulnerabilities.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any random number generation, so there are no bad randomness vulnerabilities.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any transaction ordering dependencies that can be exploited for front-running attacks.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical functionality, so there are no time manipulation vulnerabilities.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any external function calls that can be exploited for short address attacks.

Overall, the provided smart contract does not contain any of the common vulnerabilities mentioned. However, it lacks proper access control and error handling mechanisms, which can be potential security concerns.
