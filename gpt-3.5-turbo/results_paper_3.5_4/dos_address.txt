Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, I have identified the following vulnerabilities:

1. Denial of Service (Gas Limit Reached):
   - In the function `addCreditors()`, a loop is used to add 350 addresses to the `creditorAddresses` array. If this function is called multiple times, it can consume a significant amount of gas and eventually reach the gas limit. This can result in a denial of service attack, preventing other transactions from being executed.

2. Access Control:
   - The contract does not implement any access control mechanism. This means that anyone can call the `emptyCreditors()` and `addCreditors()` functions, potentially leading to unauthorized access and manipulation of the `creditorAddresses` array.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the following changes can be made:

1. Denial of Service (Gas Limit Reached):
   - Instead of using a loop to add addresses in bulk, the `addCreditors()` function can be modified to accept a single address as a parameter and add it to the `creditorAddresses` array. This will prevent the gas limit from being reached.

2. Access Control:
   - Implement an access control mechanism, such as using the OpenZeppelin `Ownable` contract, to restrict the execution of sensitive functions like `emptyCreditors()` to only the contract owner or specific authorized addresses.
