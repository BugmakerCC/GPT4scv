Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given smart contract for common vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external function calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the "onlyOwner" modifier to restrict certain functions to be called only by the owner of the contract. This ensures that access is properly controlled.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not have any arithmetic operations, so it is not vulnerable to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls, so it is not vulnerable to unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any functionality that could lead to denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any functionality that could lead to front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses the "now" keyword to get the current timestamp, which is generally safe to use.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any external function calls that could be vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the given smart contract does not seem to have any common vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that this analysis is based on the provided code snippet and may not cover all possible vulnerabilities. A more thorough analysis would require reviewing the entire contract and its dependencies.
