Here is an analysis of the vulnerabilities present in the provided smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external contract calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the "Owner" variable to control access to certain functions. However, the Owner variable can be changed by calling the "withdraw" function with a specific address. This can lead to unauthorized access if an attacker can call the "withdraw" function with their own address.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract, so it is not vulnerable to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses the "call" function to execute arbitrary code. However, it does not check the return value of the call, which can result in silent failures if the called contract reverts or throws an exception.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any specific measures to prevent denial of service attacks. An attacker can repeatedly call the "redeem" function with small amounts of ether to consume all the gas and prevent other users from interacting with the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not include any random number generation, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any critical operations that can be front-run.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not depend on timestamps for any critical operations, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities.

In summary, the vulnerabilities present in the contract are access control issues, unchecked return values for low-level calls, and denial of service vulnerabilities.
