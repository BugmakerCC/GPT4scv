Based on the provided smart contract, here is the analysis for the vulnerabilities mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is not susceptible to reentrancy attacks as it does not have any external contract calls.

2. Access Control: The contract has a basic access control mechanism in place. The `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict certain functions to be called only by the owner.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract that could lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The contract does not have any low-level calls that require checking return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any specific vulnerabilities that could lead to denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any random number generation, so there are no vulnerabilities related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any sensitive operations that could be front-run by miners.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical operations.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any functions that are vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the provided smart contract seems to be relatively secure and does not exhibit any significant vulnerabilities. However, it is always recommended to conduct a thorough security audit to ensure the contract's robustness.
