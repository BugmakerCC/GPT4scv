Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not contain any external calls to other contracts, so there is no direct risk of reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms. Any address can call the `sendToWinner()` and `withdrawLeftOver()` functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the provided code, so there is no risk of integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses the `send()` function to transfer funds, but it does not check the return value. This can lead to silent failing sends, where the contract continues execution even if the send operation fails.

5. Denial of Service: There are no gas limit reached or unexpected throw scenarios in the provided code. However, if an attacker successfully calls `withdrawLeftOver()` before `sendToWinner()`, they can drain the contract balance, making it impossible for the winner to receive their funds.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not contain any randomness-related functionality.

7. Front-Running: There are no time-sensitive operations or transaction ordering dependencies in the provided code.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not use the block timestamp, so there is no direct risk of timestamp manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not contain any off-chain interactions or client-facing vulnerabilities.

To summarize, the provided smart contract is vulnerable to the following issues:

- Lack of access control, allowing any address to call critical functions.
- Failure to check the return value of the `send()` function, leading to potential silent failing sends.
- Possibility of a denial of service attack by draining the contract balance before the winner can receive their funds.

These vulnerabilities should be addressed to improve the security of the contract.
