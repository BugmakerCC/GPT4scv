Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the common vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls, so there is no risk of reentrancy vulnerability.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the Ownable contract to implement an owner modifier and ensure that certain functions can only be called by the owner.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract, so there is no risk of integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses the low-level call function to transfer tokens, but it does not check the return value. This can potentially lead to silent failures if the token transfer fails.

5. Denial of Service: There are no vulnerabilities related to gas limit reached, unexpected throw, unexpected kill, or breached access control in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no random number generation functions in the contract, so there is no risk of bad randomness vulnerability.

7. Front-Running: There are no vulnerable functions that could be exploited for front-running attacks.

8. Time manipulation: There are no dependencies on timestamps in the contract, so there is no risk of time manipulation vulnerability.

9. Short Address Attack: There are no off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities in the contract.

Overall, the contract does not have any major vulnerabilities. However, it should be noted that the contract does not follow best practices for checking return values of low-level calls, which could lead to potential issues if the token transfer fails. Additionally, the contract could benefit from documentation and better function naming conventions.
