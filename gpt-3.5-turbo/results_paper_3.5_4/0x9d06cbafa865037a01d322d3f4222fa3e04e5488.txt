Here is an analysis of the vulnerabilities present in the given smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract has an owner variable and a modifier that restricts access to certain functions to only the owner. This provides basic access control.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could lead to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The contract uses a low-level call to transfer tokens in the tokens_buy function. However, it does not check the return value of the call, which could potentially lead to silent failures. It should include a check for success or failure of the call and handle any failures appropriately.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any specific mechanisms in place to prevent denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any functionality that is vulnerable to front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps or time-dependent logic, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not involve any off-chain interactions that could be vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the contract has some basic access control and does not have any major vulnerabilities. However, it could benefit from additional checks and safeguards to handle failures in low-level calls and prevent potential denial of service attacks.
