Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The smart contract does not have any external contract calls, so it is not susceptible to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The smart contract uses the `require(tx.origin == owner)` statement to check if the caller is the owner of the contract. This is a basic form of access control, but it is not secure as the `tx.origin` can be manipulated by an attacker. It is recommended to use `msg.sender` instead of `tx.origin` for access control.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The smart contract does not have any arithmetic operations, so it is not susceptible to arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The smart contract does not have any low-level calls, so it is not susceptible to unchecked return value issues.

5. Denial of Service: The smart contract does not have any gas limit-related issues or unexpected throw/kill statements. However, there is a potential access control issue if the caller is not the owner, as they can drain the contract's balance.

6. Bad Randomness: The smart contract does not have any randomness-related functionality, so it is not susceptible to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The smart contract does not have any critical sequential operations that could be exploited by front-runners.

8. Time Manipulation: The smart contract does not have any time-dependent functionality, so it is not susceptible to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The smart contract does not have any off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the smart contract is vulnerable to access control issues and potential denial of service attacks if the caller is not the owner. It is recommended to use `msg.sender` instead of `tx.origin` for access control and add additional safeguards to prevent unauthorized withdrawals.
