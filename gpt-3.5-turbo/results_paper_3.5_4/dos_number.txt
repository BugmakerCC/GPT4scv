After reviewing the provided smart contract, I have identified several vulnerabilities. Let's go through each of them step by step:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external function calls or interactions with other contracts, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the functions. This can be a potential security vulnerability, as sensitive operations should be restricted to authorized users only.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations, so it is not vulnerable to arithmetic issues like integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls, so there are no unchecked return values to be concerned about.

5. Denial of Service: The contract has two functions, `clear()` and `clearDOS()`, that can cause a denial of service if the gas limit is reached. The gas consumption of these functions depends on the actual gas limit and the number of elements in the `array` storage variable. It is important to note that the `insertNnumbers()` function can also consume a significant amount of gas if the `numbers` parameter is larger than a certain threshold (around 382). This can potentially lead to a denial of service if the gas limit is reached.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness, so there is no vulnerability related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not involve any sensitive or valuable operations that could be front-run, so it is not vulnerable to front-running attacks.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps or time-dependent operations, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any external function calls or interactions with other contracts, so it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.

To summarize, the vulnerabilities present in the provided smart contract are:

- Access Control: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms.
- Denial of Service: The `clear()` and `clearDOS()` functions can cause a denial of service if the gas limit is reached.
- Potential Denial of Service: The `insertNnumbers()` function can consume a significant amount of gas if the `numbers` parameter is larger than a certain threshold.

It is recommended to address these vulnerabilities by implementing proper access control mechanisms and reviewing the gas consumption of the functions to prevent potential denial of service attacks.
