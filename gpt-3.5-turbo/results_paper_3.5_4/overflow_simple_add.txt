After reviewing the provided smart contract, it appears to be vulnerable to the following vulnerabilities:

1. Arithmetic Issues (Integer Overflow): The `add` function in the contract adds the `deposit` value to the `balance` variable without checking for potential overflow. If the `balance` variable reaches its maximum value (2^256 - 1), adding any value to it will result in an overflow, causing the `balance` variable to wrap around to zero.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the addition does not result in an overflow. One way to do this is by using a SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations.

Here's an updated version of the contract that incorporates the SafeMath library:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.4.25;

library SafeMath {
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 c = a + b;
        require(c >= a, "Integer overflow");
        return c;
    }
}

contract Overflow_Add {
    using SafeMath for uint256;
    uint public balance = 1;

    function add(uint256 deposit) public {
        balance = balance.add(deposit);
    }
}
```

By using the `add` function from the SafeMath library, we ensure that the addition operation is performed safely, and an exception is thrown if an overflow is detected.

It's worth noting that this contract doesn't exhibit the other vulnerabilities mentioned in your list.
