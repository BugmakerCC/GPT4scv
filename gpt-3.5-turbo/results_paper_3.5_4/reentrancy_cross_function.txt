Here is an analysis of the provided smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy:
The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The `withdrawBalance` function allows a user to withdraw their balance, but the contract does not update the user's balance before calling the `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)`. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `withdrawBalance` function repeatedly before the balance is updated, allowing them to drain the contract's balance.

2. Access Control:
The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms. Any user can call the `transfer` and `withdrawBalance` functions, potentially leading to unauthorized transfers or withdrawals.

3. Arithmetic Issues:
There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the provided contract, so there is no direct vulnerability related to arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls:
The contract uses a low-level call to transfer funds to the `msg.sender`. However, it does not check the return value of the call, which can result in a failed transfer without any indication or handling of the failure.

5. Denial of Service:
There are no specific vulnerabilities related to denial of service attacks in the provided contract.

6. Bad Randomness:
There are no random number generation or reliance on random values in the provided contract, so there is no direct vulnerability related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running:
The contract does not perform any operations susceptible to front-running attacks, such as relying on external data or depending on transaction ordering.

8. Time Manipulation:
The contract does not rely on timestamps or use them in a way that can be manipulated, so there is no direct vulnerability related to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack:
The contract does not process any off-chain data or rely on client vulnerabilities, so there is no direct vulnerability related to short address attacks.

In summary, the provided contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks and lacks proper access control. It also does not check the return value of a low-level call, which may result in failed transfers.
