Based on the provided smart contract, let's analyze each vulnerability:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not contain any external function calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract uses a simple access control mechanism where the owner is set in the constructor and checked in the `sendTo` function. This is a basic form of access control and does not have any major vulnerabilities.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract, so there are no vulnerabilities related to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The contract does not use low-level calls, so there are no unchecked return value vulnerabilities.

5. Denial of Service: There are no loops or unbounded operations that could cause a denial of service. However, the contract does not have any gas limit checks, so it is possible for an attacker to consume all the available gas by repeatedly calling the `sendTo` function, preventing other transactions from being executed.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness, so there are no vulnerabilities related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not involve any sensitive operations that could be front-run.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps, so there are no vulnerabilities related to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any function that accepts variable-length input, so there are no vulnerabilities related to short address attacks.

Overall, the provided smart contract does not have any major vulnerabilities, but it lacks some best practices such as gas limit checks and a more robust access control mechanism.
