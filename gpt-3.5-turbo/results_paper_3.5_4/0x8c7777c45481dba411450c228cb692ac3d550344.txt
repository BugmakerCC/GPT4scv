I will analyze the smart contract for the nine common vulnerabilities you mentioned. 

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability occurs when a contract calls an external contract that can call back into the calling contract before the first call is completed. In this contract, the CashOut function is susceptible to reentrancy because it calls the 'call' function on the msg.sender contract before updating the balance. This can allow malicious contracts to repeatedly call the CashOut function and drain the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: This vulnerability refers to improper access control mechanisms that allow unauthorized users to perform certain actions. In this contract, there are no access control mechanisms in place, so anyone can call the Deposit and CashOut functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not have explicit checks for integer overflow or underflow. It is important to ensure that arithmetic operations do not result in unexpected behavior due to overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses the 'call' function without checking the return value in the CashOut function. It is important to check the return value of external calls to handle any potential failures.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limits or other mechanisms to prevent denial of service attacks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large amount of ether to the contract, causing it to run out of gas and preventing other users from using the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any mechanism to generate random numbers. If randomness is required, it is important to use a secure source of randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any mechanisms to prevent front-running attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage. This can lead to unfair outcomes in certain scenarios.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses the 'now' keyword to get the current timestamp. However, the 'now' keyword can be manipulated by miners to some extent. It is important to be aware of the limitations of using timestamps in smart contracts.

9. Short Address Attack: This vulnerability refers to issues that can arise from the way input data is handled. The contract does not seem to be directly susceptible to short address attacks.

In summary, the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy, access control, unchecked return values for low-level calls, denial of service, bad randomness, front-running, and time manipulation. It is important to address these vulnerabilities to ensure the contract's security.
