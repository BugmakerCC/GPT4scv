After analyzing the provided smart contract, I have identified the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `CashOut` function allows the contract owner to withdraw funds from their account. However, the `call.value()` method is used without any checks, which makes the contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `CashOut` function repeatedly before the balance is updated, allowing them to drain the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism implemented in the contract. Anyone can call the `Deposit` and `CashOut` functions, which may lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of funds.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The `call.value()` method is used to send Ether to the `msg.sender`. However, the return value of this call is not checked, which can result in a failed transfer without any indication.

4. Denial of Service: The contract does not implement any gas limits or checks, which may lead to a denial of service attack if an attacker sends a large amount of Ether to the contract, consuming all available gas.

5. Bad Randomness: The contract does not include any mechanism to generate secure random numbers. This can be exploited by attackers to predict outcomes or game the system.

6. Time Manipulation: The contract uses the `now` keyword to store the timestamp of the transaction. However, this timestamp can be manipulated by miners, compromising the integrity of time-dependent operations.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the following steps can be taken:

1. Implement a mutex lock or state variable to prevent reentrancy attacks in the `CashOut` function.
2. Implement an access control mechanism to restrict who can call the `Deposit` and `CashOut` functions.
3. Check the return value of the `call.value()` method and handle failed transfers appropriately.
4. Implement gas limits and checks to prevent denial of service attacks.
5. Use a secure source of randomness in the contract, such as an Oracle or external service.
6. Avoid relying on `now` for critical time-dependent operations and consider using block timestamps instead.
