Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities I have identified:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks in the `Get()` function. When the `msg.value` is greater than 1 ether, the contract transfers the entire balance to the `Owner` address and then transfers the balance again to the `msg.sender`. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `Get()` function recursively to drain the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: The contract uses a simple address comparison to check if `msg.sender` is the `Owner`. This is not a secure way to implement access control as the `Owner` address can be easily changed by calling the `withdraw()` function with `0x1Fb3acdBa788CA50Ce165E5A4151f05187C67cd6` as the `msg.sender`.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the contract, so there is no direct vulnerability related to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The `Command()` function allows the `Owner` to execute arbitrary code on external contracts. However, there is no check on the return values of these calls, which can lead to silent failures if the called contract reverts or throws an exception.

5. Denial of Service: There is no explicit vulnerability related to gas limit reached or unexpected throws. However, if an attacker can become the `Owner` (as discussed in vulnerability 2), they can deny service by constantly calling the `withdraw()` function.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any random number generation, so there is no direct vulnerability related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: There is no explicit vulnerability related to front-running attacks in this contract.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps, so there is no direct vulnerability related to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not involve any off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities, so there is no direct vulnerability related to short address attacks.

To summarize, the main vulnerabilities in this contract are reentrancy and access control issues.
