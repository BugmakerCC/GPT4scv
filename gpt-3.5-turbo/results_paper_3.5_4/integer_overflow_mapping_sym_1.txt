After reviewing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities detected:

1. Arithmetic Issues (Integer Underflow): The `init` function subtracts the value `v` from the value stored in the mapping `map[k]`. However, if `v` is greater than the stored value, an integer underflow will occur, resulting in an unexpected value for `map[k]`.

To fix this vulnerability, you can add a check to ensure that the subtraction does not result in an underflow. One possible solution is to use a require statement to verify that the subtraction will not cause an underflow:

```solidity
function init(uint256 k, uint256 v) public {
    require(map[k] >= v, "Underflow detected");
    map[k] -= v;
}
```

By adding this check, the contract will throw an exception if an underflow is detected.

2. Access Control: The provided smart contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place. This means that anyone can call the `init` function and modify the values in the mapping `map`. Consider adding access control modifiers such as `onlyOwner` to restrict who can call certain functions.

3. Short Address Attack: The contract does not perform any checks to prevent short address attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to pass a shorter-than-expected argument when calling a function, potentially causing issues in the contract logic. To mitigate this vulnerability, you can add a check to ensure that the length of the provided arguments is as expected.

It is important to note that the other vulnerabilities listed in your initial request are not present in this specific smart contract.
