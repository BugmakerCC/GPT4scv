Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy:
The `CashOut` function is susceptible to reentrancy attacks. After deducting the `_am` amount from the sender's balance, it calls the `TransferLog.AddMessage` function. If the `TransferLog.AddMessage` function interacts with an external contract that can call back into the `CashOut` function, it can lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities.

2. Access Control:
The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms. Anyone can call the `Deposit` and `CashOut` functions without any restrictions. This can result in unauthorized access and manipulation of balances.

3. Arithmetic Issues:
There are no explicit checks for integer overflow or underflow in the contract. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the balances exceed the maximum or minimum values that can be stored in the uint data type.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low Level Calls:
The contract uses the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` to send the requested amount of Ether to the sender. However, it does not check the return value of this call, which can lead to silent failures and loss of funds.

5. Denial of Service:
The contract does not have any gas limit checks or mechanisms to prevent denial of service attacks. An attacker could potentially drain the contract's funds or cause out-of-gas errors.

6. Bad Randomness:
The contract does not have any built-in mechanisms to ensure secure and unpredictable randomness. This can be exploited by malicious actors to manipulate the outcome of certain operations relying on random numbers.

7. Front-Running:
The contract does not have any protections against front-running attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage.

8. Time Manipulation:
The contract relies on the `now` keyword to determine the timestamp. However, this can be manipulated by miners, leading to timestamp dependence vulnerabilities.

9. Short Address Attack:
The contract does not explicitly check for short address attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the length of the input data to exploit off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the contract should implement the following best practices:

- Implement proper access control mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive functions.
- Use safe arithmetic libraries or explicitly check for integer overflow and underflow.
- Check the return values of low-level calls and handle failures gracefully.
- Implement gas limit checks and other mechanisms to prevent denial of service attacks.
- Use secure randomness mechanisms like oracles or commit-reveal schemes.
- Implement protections against front-running attacks such as using secure transaction ordering mechanisms.
- Avoid timestamp dependence by using block numbers or other secure sources of time.
- Implement checks to prevent short address attacks and other off-chain vulnerabilities.

Note: The above suggestions are meant to address the identified vulnerabilities. However, a comprehensive security audit is recommended to ensure the contract's overall security.
