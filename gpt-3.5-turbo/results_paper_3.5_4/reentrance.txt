The provided smart contract is vulnerable to the Reentrancy attack. This vulnerability occurs when an external contract can call the `withdraw` function multiple times before it finishes executing, allowing it to drain the contract's balance.

Here's the step-by-step analysis of the smart contract for the mentioned vulnerability:

1. The contract has a mapping called `balances`, which stores the balance of each address.

2. The `donate` function allows users to send Ether to the contract and increases the balance of the specified address.

3. The `balanceOf` function returns the balance of a given address.

4. The `withdraw` function allows users to withdraw a specified amount of Ether from their balance. If the user has enough balance, the function transfers the Ether to the user's address using `msg.sender.call.value(_amount)()`.

5. The problem lies in the `withdraw` function, where the order of operations is incorrect. The contract first performs the external call to the user's address without reducing the balance, which can lead to a reentrancy attack.

6. An attacker can create a malicious contract that repeatedly calls the `withdraw` function before it has a chance to reduce the balance. This allows the attacker to drain the contract's balance multiple times.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should reduce the balance before performing any external calls. The corrected `withdraw` function should look like this:

```solidity
function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
  if(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount) {
    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    if(msg.sender.call.value(_amount)()) {
      // Handle successful withdrawal
    }
  }
}
```

By reducing the balance before making the external call, the contract ensures that the user can only withdraw their available balance once per transaction.
