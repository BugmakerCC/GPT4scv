The provided smart contract does not contain all of the mentioned vulnerabilities. However, it does have a couple of issues:

1. Access Control: The `onlyowner` modifier is used to restrict access to the `withdraw` function. Only the `owner` address can call this function.

2. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls or use any external contracts, so the reentrancy vulnerability is not present.

To summarize, the smart contract does not contain all of the mentioned vulnerabilities, but it does have some access control measures in place, which is generally a good practice.
