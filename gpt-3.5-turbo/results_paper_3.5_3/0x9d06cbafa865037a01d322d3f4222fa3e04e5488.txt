Here is the analysis of the smart contract for the common vulnerabilities mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls or interact with other contracts, so there is no risk of reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the onlyOwner modifier to restrict access to certain functions, ensuring that only the owner can execute them. However, it is important to review the implementation of the onlyOwner modifier to ensure it is secure.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract performs arithmetic operations in the tokens_buy function to calculate the number of tokens to buy. However, there are no checks for integer overflow or underflow. It is recommended to add checks to prevent these issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract makes a low-level call to the ERC20 contract to transfer tokens. However, it does not check the return value of the call. This can lead to silent failures if the transfer fails. It is recommended to check the return value and handle any failures appropriately.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any specific vulnerabilities related to denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any randomness-related vulnerabilities.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any specific vulnerabilities related to front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any vulnerabilities related to timestamp dependence.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any vulnerabilities related to off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract does not have any critical vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to review the implementation of the onlyOwner modifier and add checks for integer overflow and underflow. Additionally, checking the return value of the low-level call and handling failures appropriately is also recommended.
