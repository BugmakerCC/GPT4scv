Here is an analysis of the provided smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy.

2. Access Control: There are no explicit access control mechanisms in the contract. The only requirement is that the sender must send 1 ether to participate in the challenge. However, this can be considered as a basic access control mechanism.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could lead to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls, so this vulnerability is not present.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any mechanisms that could lead to a denial of service attack.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses the keccak256 hash function with the blockhash and current timestamp as inputs to generate a random number. While this method is not completely secure, it is not considered a severe vulnerability in this context.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not involve any transactions that could be front-run.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses the 'now' keyword to get the current timestamp. This can be manipulated by miners to some extent but does not pose a significant vulnerability in this context.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not make any external calls that could be vulnerable to a short address attack.

Overall, the provided smart contract does not seem to have any major vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that this analysis is limited to the provided code and does not consider potential vulnerabilities in dependencies or interactions with other contracts.
