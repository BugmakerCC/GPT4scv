After analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be detected:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because the `withdrawBalance` function first updates the user's balance to 0 and then calls `send` to transfer the funds. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls `withdrawBalance` repeatedly before the `send` function completes, allowing them to drain the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: The contract lacks any access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the `withdrawBalance` function and withdraw funds from any address.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The `send` function is used to transfer funds, but it does not check the return value. If the `send` call fails, the contract will not react or handle the failure, potentially causing funds to be lost.

To fix these vulnerabilities, you should consider the following changes:

- Implement a withdrawal pattern that prevents reentrancy attacks, such as the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern.
- Add access control mechanisms to restrict who can call the `withdrawBalance` function and withdraw funds.
- Check the return value of the `send` function and handle failures appropriately.

Here's an updated version of the contract with these vulnerabilities addressed:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract SendBack {
    mapping (address => uint) userBalances;
    mapping (address => bool) public isUser;

    function withdrawBalance() public {
        require(isUser[msg.sender]); // Add access control
        
        uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
        userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
        
        // Use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern to prevent reentrancy
        require(msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)());
    }
}
```

In this updated version:
- An `isUser` mapping is added to keep track of valid users who can withdraw funds.
- The `withdrawBalance` function is made public and includes a `require` statement to check if the caller is a valid user.
- The `send` function is replaced with a direct `call.value` to transfer funds, and the return value is checked using `require`.
