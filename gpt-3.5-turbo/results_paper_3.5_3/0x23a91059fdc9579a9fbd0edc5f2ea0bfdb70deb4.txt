Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `CashOut` function is susceptible to reentrancy vulnerability. After calling `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`, it updates the balance of the sender before executing any further code. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls back into the `CashOut` function, causing the balance to be repeatedly deducted and potentially leading to a drain of funds.

2. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism in place for the `Deposit` and `CashOut` functions. Anyone can deposit and withdraw funds from any address.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit checks for integer overflow or underflow in this contract. It is important to ensure that arithmetic operations do not result in unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The return value of the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` call is not checked. If the call fails (returns false), the balances will still be deducted, resulting in a loss of funds.

5. Denial of Service: There are no explicit gas limit checks in this contract, which could allow an attacker to consume all available gas, preventing other transactions from executing.

6. Bad Randomness: This contract does not involve any randomness, so the vulnerability is not applicable here.

7. Front-Running: There are no specific vulnerabilities related to front-running in this contract.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps, so this vulnerability is not relevant.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract does not involve any off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities, so this vulnerability is not applicable here.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the following steps can be taken:

- Implement reentrancy guards using the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern.
- Implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can deposit and withdraw funds.
- Add checks for integer overflow/underflow to prevent unexpected behavior.
- Check the return value of low-level calls and handle failures appropriately.
- Implement gas limit checks to prevent DoS attacks.
- Consider using a secure source of randomness if required.
- Be cautious of front-running attacks and consider appropriate ordering mechanisms if needed.

It is important to note that this analysis is based on the provided code snippet and may not cover all possible vulnerabilities. A thorough security audit is recommended before deploying this contract.
