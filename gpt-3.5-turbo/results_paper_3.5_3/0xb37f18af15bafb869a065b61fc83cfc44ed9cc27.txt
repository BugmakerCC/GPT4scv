Here is an analysis of the provided smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls or use any external contracts, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract has an "onlyOwner" modifier that restricts certain functions to be executed only by the owner. This provides basic access control.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations, so it is not vulnerable to arithmetic issues like integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses the "transfer" function, which automatically reverts in case of failure. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to unchecked return values for low-level calls.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any loops or unbounded operations that could lead to a denial of service attack. However, the contract does not have any gas limit checks, so it is possible for the owner to consume all the gas in a transaction, preventing other transactions from being executed.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness, so this vulnerability does not apply.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any critical operations that could be front-run by miners or other users.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical operations, so time manipulation is not a concern.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any external calls that could be vulnerable to the short address attack.

Overall, the provided smart contract does not seem to have any major vulnerabilities. However, it is always recommended to conduct a thorough security audit to ensure the contract's safety.
