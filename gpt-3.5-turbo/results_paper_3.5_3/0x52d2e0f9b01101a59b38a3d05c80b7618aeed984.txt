Here is an analysis of the provided smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not contain any external function calls that could potentially lead to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms. Any address can call the `withdrawTokens` and `withdrawEther` functions, potentially allowing unauthorized access.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract that could lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses the `.call` function to execute external calls, but it does not check the return value. This can lead to silent failures if the called function reverts or throws an exception.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any specific mechanisms to prevent gas limit reached, unexpected throw, or unexpected kill scenarios. However, it does not contain any loops or complex operations that could consume excessive gas.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any random number generation that could be manipulated.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not involve any sensitive transactions or rely on specific transaction ordering. Therefore, front-running is not a concern.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamp values for any critical operations.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not contain any off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract is relatively simple and does not exhibit any critical vulnerabilities. However, it lacks access control mechanisms, does not check the return values of low-level calls, and potentially exposes sensitive functionality to unauthorized users.
