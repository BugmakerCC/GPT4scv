After analyzing the smart contract provided, here are the vulnerabilities that I found:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks in the `GetPie` function. When `msg.value` is greater than 1 ether, it transfers the contract's balance to the `Owner` address and then transfers the balance back to the `msg.sender`. An attacker can exploit this by creating a malicious contract that calls the `GetPie` function recursively, draining the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: The contract uses a basic access control mechanism by checking if `msg.sender` is equal to the `Owner` address. However, there is a vulnerability in the `withdraw` function. If an attacker knows the `Owner` address (0x1Fb3acdBa788CA50Ce165E5A4151f05187C67cd6), they can bypass the access control check and withdraw the contract's balance.

3. Denial of Service: There is a potential denial of service vulnerability in the `withdraw` function. If an attacker repeatedly calls the `withdraw` function, it will deplete the contract's balance and prevent legitimate users from withdrawing their funds.

4. Short Address Attack: The contract is not vulnerable to a short address attack as it does not perform any checks or operations based on the length of the input address.

To address these vulnerabilities, you can make the following changes to the contract:

1. Implement a mutex to prevent reentrancy attacks. Use the `nonReentrant` modifier to restrict multiple calls to sensitive functions.

2. Improve access control by using a more secure mechanism like the OpenZeppelin `Ownable` contract. Restrict sensitive functions only to the contract owner.

3. Implement gas limits and rate limiting mechanisms to prevent denial of service attacks.

4. Ensure that all low-level calls return a value and check the return value to handle any potential errors.

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of all possible vulnerabilities, and further analysis and testing are recommended.
