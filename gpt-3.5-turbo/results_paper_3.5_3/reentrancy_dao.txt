Here is an analysis of the given smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it performs an external call to the `msg.sender` contract before updating the credit balance. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls back the `withdrawAll` function repeatedly, draining the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism in place. Any address can call the `withdrawAll` and `deposit` functions, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of funds.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the contract that could lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The contract uses the `call` function to send Ether to the `msg.sender` contract. However, it does not check the return value of the call, which can lead to a silent failure if the recipient contract rejects the Ether.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit gas limit checks or mechanisms to prevent denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness generation, so this vulnerability is not applicable.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any sensitive operations that could be front-run or race condition prone.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any dependency on block timestamps, so this vulnerability is not applicable.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain communication or client vulnerabilities.

To summarize, the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, lacks access control, and does not handle unchecked return values properly. It does not contain other mentioned vulnerabilities.
