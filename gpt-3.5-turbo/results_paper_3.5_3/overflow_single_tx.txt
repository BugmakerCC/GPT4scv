After analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities detected:

1. Integer Overflow: The functions `overflowaddtostate`, `overflowmultostate`, and `underflowtostate` perform arithmetic operations on the `count` variable without checking for overflow or underflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior and result in incorrect values being stored in the state variable.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The functions `overflowlocalonly`, `overflowmulocalonly`, and `underflowlocalonly` perform arithmetic operations but do not update the state variable. However, they do not check the return values of these operations, which can result in silent failures if the calculations exceed the maximum or minimum values for the uint type.

It is important to note that the contract does not contain vulnerabilities related to reentrancy, access control, denial of service, bad randomness, front-running, time manipulation, or short address attacks.
