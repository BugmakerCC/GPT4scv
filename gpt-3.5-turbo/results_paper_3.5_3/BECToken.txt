The smart contract provided does not have any of the mentioned vulnerabilities. Here is an analysis of the contract with respect to each vulnerability:

1. Reentrancy: There are no external calls made within the contract that could lead to a reentrancy vulnerability.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms implemented.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The SafeMath library is used for arithmetic operations, which prevents integer overflow and underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: There are no low level calls made within the contract.

5. Denial of Service: There are no operations within the contract that could lead to denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not generate any random numbers, so there is no vulnerability related to randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any time-dependent or ordering-dependent operations.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on the timestamp for any critical operations.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain interactions that could lead to short address attacks.

Overall, the provided smart contract appears to be secure against the mentioned vulnerabilities.
