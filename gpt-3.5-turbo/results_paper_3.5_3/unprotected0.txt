Here is an analysis of the smart contract provided for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract has a modifier `onlyowner` that checks if the caller is the owner. However, this modifier is not used in the `changeOwner` function, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract, so it is not vulnerable to arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: There are no low-level calls in the contract, so it is not vulnerable to unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any functionality that can lead to denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no random number generations in the contract, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not involve any sensitive operations that can be front-run.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any payable functions, so it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.

Recommendation:
- To fix the access control vulnerability, the `changeOwner` function should include the `onlyowner` modifier to ensure that only the owner can change the owner address.

Updated code:
```
function changeOwner_fixed(address _newOwner)
    public
    onlyowner
{
    owner = _newOwner;
}
```

By making this change, the contract will be protected against unauthorized access to the `changeOwner` function.
