Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, I have identified the vulnerability known as Reentrancy. This vulnerability occurs when a contract calls an external contract that has a fallback function, and the external contract calls back into the original contract before the first call has completed.

In this contract, the `withdraw` function is susceptible to reentrancy attacks. Here's the vulnerable code:

```solidity
function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
    if(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount) {
      
      if(msg.sender.call.value(_amount)()) {
        _amount;
      }
      balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    }
}
```

The `withdraw` function checks if the balance of the `msg.sender` is greater than or equal to the requested withdrawal amount `_amount`. If the condition is true, it calls the `call.value` function to transfer the requested amount of Ether to the `msg.sender`. However, this is where the vulnerability lies.

The `call.value` function can execute any arbitrary code in the receiving contract, including calling back into the `withdraw` function before the balance is updated. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the `withdraw` function, draining the contract's balance and potentially causing it to run out of gas.

To fix this vulnerability, you should update the contract's state before executing the external call. Here's an example of a modified `withdraw` function that mitigates the reentrancy vulnerability:

```solidity
function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
    if(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount) {
      balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
      
      if(msg.sender.call.value(_amount)()) {
        // Handle successful withdrawal
      }
    }
}
```

By updating the balance of the `msg.sender` before making the external call, you ensure that the contract's state is consistent and prevent reentrancy attacks.
