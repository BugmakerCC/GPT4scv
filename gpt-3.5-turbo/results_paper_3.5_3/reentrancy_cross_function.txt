Based on my analysis of the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities it contains:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because the `withdrawBalance` function allows the contract to make an external call to the caller's code before updating the user balance. This allows an attacker to call the `withdrawBalance` function repeatedly, executing their malicious code and draining the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the `transfer` and `withdrawBalance` functions. This may lead to unauthorized transfers and withdrawals.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not handle potential integer overflow or underflow when updating user balances. If the `amount` parameter in the `transfer` function exceeds the maximum value of `uint`, it may result in an arithmetic issue.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The contract uses a low-level call to transfer funds to the caller in the `withdrawBalance` function. However, it does not check the return value of the call, which can lead to silent failures if the transfer fails.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the contract should implement the following best practices:

1. Reentrancy: Use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern to avoid reentrancy attacks. This involves updating the user balance before making any external calls.

2. Access Control: Implement access control mechanisms, such as role-based permissions or whitelisting, to ensure that only authorized users can call sensitive functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: Add checks to prevent integer overflow and underflow, such as using SafeMath library functions for arithmetic operations.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: Check the return value of low-level calls and handle failures appropriately, such as reverting the state changes if the transfer fails.

Here's an updated version of the contract that addresses these vulnerabilities:

pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

import "./SafeMath.sol";

contract Reentrancy_cross_function {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    mapping (address => uint) private userBalances;

    function transfer(address to, uint amount) public {
        require(userBalances[msg.sender] >= amount);
        
        userBalances[to] = userBalances[to].add(amount);
        userBalances[msg.sender] = userBalances[msg.sender].sub(amount);
    }

    function withdrawBalance() public {
        uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
        require(amountToWithdraw > 0);
        
        userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
        
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("");
        require(success);
    }
}

Note: In the updated contract, I assumed the existence of a SafeMath library for handling arithmetic operations safely. You can find a widely used SafeMath library implementation on OpenZeppelin's GitHub repository.
