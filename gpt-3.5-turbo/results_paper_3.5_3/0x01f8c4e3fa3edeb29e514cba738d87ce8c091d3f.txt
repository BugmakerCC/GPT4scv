After analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities detected:

1. Reentrancy: The `Collect` function is susceptible to reentrancy attacks. When `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is executed, it allows the called contract to call back into the `PERSONAL_BANK` contract before the state is updated. This could allow an attacker to repeatedly call the `Collect` function and drain the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: There is no proper access control mechanism in place. Anyone can deposit and collect funds from any account, which may not be intended behavior.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit checks for integer overflow or underflow in the contract. This leaves the contract vulnerable to potential issues arising from improper arithmetic calculations.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not check the return value of the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` call. This can lead to silent failures if the call reverts or fails for any reason, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit checks, which could lead to potential out-of-gas attacks. Additionally, the contract does not handle unexpected throws or kills, which could also result in denial of service scenarios.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure secure and unpredictable randomness, which could be exploited by attackers.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not handle front-running attacks, where the order of transactions can be manipulated to the attacker's advantage.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract relies on the `now` keyword for timestamp validation, which can be manipulated by miners to execute transactions at specific times or perform other malicious actions.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not properly handle short address attacks, where an attacker can pass a shorter address than expected, potentially leading to vulnerable behavior.

To enhance the security of the smart contract, it is recommended to address these vulnerabilities and implement appropriate security measures.
