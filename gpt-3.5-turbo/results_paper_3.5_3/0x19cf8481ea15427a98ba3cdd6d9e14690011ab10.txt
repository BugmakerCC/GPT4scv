Vulnerabilities found in the smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any code that allows an external contract to call back into it, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms implemented. This means that anyone can call the transfer, transferFrom, approve, and other functions that modify the contract's state.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract uses the SafeMath library
