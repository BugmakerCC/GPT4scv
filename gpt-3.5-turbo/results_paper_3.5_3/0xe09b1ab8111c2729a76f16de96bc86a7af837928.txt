Here are the vulnerabilities I found in the smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any checks to prevent reentrancy attacks, where an external contract can call back into this contract before the previous call has completed.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to authorized users only. Anyone can call the wager, play, refund, and withdraw functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not have any checks for integer overflow or underflow, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not check the return values of external calls, which can result in silent failures or vulnerabilities.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit checks or mechanisms to prevent unexpected throw, unexpected kill, or breached access control, which can lead to denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses blockhash as a source of randomness, which can be manipulated by miners to predict the outcome of the game.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any protection against front-running attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the order or timing of transactions to gain an unfair advantage.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any checks to prevent manipulation of timestamps, which can be used to exploit time-dependent functions.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any checks to prevent short address attacks, where an attacker can submit a transaction with a truncated address to manipulate the contract's state.

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of all possible vulnerabilities, and further analysis is needed to ensure the security of the smart contract.
