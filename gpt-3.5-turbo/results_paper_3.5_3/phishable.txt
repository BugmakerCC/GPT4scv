Here is the analysis of the smart contract for the vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external function calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract uses a simple access control mechanism by checking the `tx.origin` against the `owner` variable. This is not considered secure as `tx.origin` can be manipulated by attackers. It is recommended to use the `msg.sender` instead.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract, so it is not vulnerable to arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not have any low-level calls, so it is not vulnerable to unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas-related vulnerabilities or unbounded loops that could lead to DoS attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any randomness-related vulnerabilities.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any functions that are susceptible to front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any timestamp dependencies, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract seems to be relatively secure, except for the access control vulnerability mentioned in point 2. It is recommended to use `msg.sender` instead of `tx.origin` for access control checks.
