Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, I have identified the following vulnerabilities:

1. Time Manipulation: The contract uses the `now` keyword, which can be manipulated by miners to exploit the contract. This vulnerability can be exploited by a miner to control the execution flow of the contract.

2. Time Manipulation: The `randomGen()` function uses `block.timestamp` to generate a random number. However, `block.timestamp` can also be manipulated by miners to predict or control the outcome of the random number generation.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, it is recommended to use an external and trusted source of randomness, such as an oracle or a random number generator contract. Additionally, it is important to avoid using `block.timestamp` for critical operations.

Please note that while I have identified these vulnerabilities, there may be other potential issues within the contract. It is always recommended to conduct a thorough security audit of the entire contract code by a professional auditor.
