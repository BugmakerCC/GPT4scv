Here is a step-by-step analysis of the smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `sendToWinner()` function does not have any recursive calls or external contract calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy.

2. Access Control: There is no explicit access control mechanism implemented in this contract. It is important to consider who can call `sendToWinner()` and `withdrawLeftOver()` functions. If these functions should only be called by specific addresses, an access control mechanism should be added.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in this contract, so it is not vulnerable to arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses the `send()` function, which returns a boolean value indicating the success or failure of the call. However, the return value is not checked, making it susceptible to silent failing sends. It is recommended to use the `transfer()` or `call.value()` methods, which automatically revert in case of failure.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit gas limit checks or access control breaches that could lead to denial of service vulnerabilities.

6. Bad Randomness: There is no randomness generation in this contract, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any sensitive operations that could be exploited by front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any timestamp-dependent logic, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities that could lead to short address attacks.

Overall, the contract does not exhibit any significant vulnerabilities, but it lacks certain security measures like access control and proper handling of return values for low-level calls. These issues should be addressed to ensure the contract's security.
