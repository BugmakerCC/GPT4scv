This smart contract is vulnerable to the Unchecked Return Values vulnerability (SWC-104). Here's the analysis of each vulnerability:

1. Reentrancy: There is no direct vulnerability related to reentrancy in this contract. However, it's always important to be cautious when interacting with external contracts to ensure reentrancy attacks are not possible.

2. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism implemented in this contract. Anyone can call the `callchecked` and `callnotchecked` functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in this contract, so there is no vulnerability related to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: This vulnerability is present in the `callnotchecked` function. The contract uses the `callee.call()` function to make an external call but does not check the return value. This can lead to silent failures if the external call fails and returns false.

5. Denial of Service: There are no explicit denial of service vulnerabilities in this contract.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no randomness-related functionalities in this contract.

7. Front-Running: There are no functionalities in the contract that can be exploited for front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: There are no timestamp dependencies in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: There are no off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities in this contract.

To fix the vulnerability related to unchecked return values, you should check the return value of the `callee.call()` function in the `callnotchecked` function and handle the failure case appropriately.

Here's an updated version of the contract that includes the fix:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.4.25;

contract ReturnValue {
  function callchecked(address callee) public {
    require(callee.call());
  }

  function callnotchecked(address callee) public {
    require(callee.call());
  }
}
```

In this updated version, the return value of the `callee.call()` function is checked using `require()`, ensuring that the contract will revert if the external call fails.
