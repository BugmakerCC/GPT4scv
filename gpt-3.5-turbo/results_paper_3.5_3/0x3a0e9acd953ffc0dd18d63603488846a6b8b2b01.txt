Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the common vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract has an "onlyOwner" modifier, which restricts certain functions to be called only by the contract owner. However, there are multiple instances of the "owner" variable being defined within the contract, which may lead to confusion and potential access control issues.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not have any arithmetic operations, so it is not vulnerable to arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses the "call" function to transfer tokens, but it does not check the return value of the call. This can lead to silent failure if the call to the token transfer fails.

5. Denial of Service: There are no specific vulnerabilities related to denial of service in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any sensitive operations that can be front-run.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical operations, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not involve any off-chain interactions, so it is not vulnerable to short address attack.

Overall, the contract has some access control issues and does not handle the return values of low-level calls properly. It is recommended to review and address these issues to improve the security of the contract.
