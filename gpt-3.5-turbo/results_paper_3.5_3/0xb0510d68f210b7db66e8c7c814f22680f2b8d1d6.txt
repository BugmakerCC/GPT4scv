Here is an analysis of the given smart contract for the common vulnerabilities mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls that can be exploited for reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any explicit access control mechanisms. The `withdraw()` function requires the caller to be the owner, but there is no other access control for other functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, which mitigates potential issues like integer overflow and underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The contract uses the `call.value()` function for sending funds to other contracts. However, it does not check the return values for these calls, which can lead to silent failures if the called contracts have fallback functions that throw an exception.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit mechanisms to prevent denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not generate or use any random numbers, so there is no vulnerability related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any sensitive operations that can be front-run by malicious actors.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on the timestamp for any critical operations.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities that can be exploited for short address attacks.

Overall, the given smart contract does not have any major vulnerabilities based on the provided analysis. However, it is important to note that vulnerabilities may exist outside the scope of the provided information. It is always recommended to conduct a thorough security review and testing of the contract to ensure its robustness.
