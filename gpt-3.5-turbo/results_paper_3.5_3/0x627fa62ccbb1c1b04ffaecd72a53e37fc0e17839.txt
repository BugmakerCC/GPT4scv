Here is the analysis of the given smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls to other contracts, so there doesn't appear to be a direct vulnerability for reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract implements an "onlyOwner" modifier to restrict certain functions to be called only by the contract owner. However, there are multiple instances of the "owner" variable defined in different contracts, which could cause confusion and potential access control issues.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the contract, so there doesn't seem to be a vulnerability related to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses a low-level call to transfer tokens in the `WithdrawToken` function. However, it does not check the return value of the call, which could potentially lead to silent failures if the token transfer fails.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit denial of service vulnerabilities.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not rely on randomness, so there doesn't appear to be a vulnerability related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any explicit front-running vulnerabilities.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps or time-dependent logic, so there doesn't seem to be a vulnerability related to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any explicit vulnerabilities related to short address attacks or off-chain issues.

Overall, the contract seems to be relatively secure, but there are some potential access control and unchecked return value vulnerabilities that should be addressed.
