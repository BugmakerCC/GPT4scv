Here is an analysis of the provided smart contract for the common vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls to other contracts, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict certain functions to the owner. However, it does not have any other access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations on user-supplied inputs, so it is not vulnerable to arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does make a low-level call to the `donate()` function of the `whale` address. However, it does not check the return value of the call, which can lead to silent failures if the `donate()` function reverts or throws an exception.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit mechanisms to prevent denial of service attacks, such as gas limit checks or rate limiting.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses the `blockhash()` function to generate randomness for determining winners. However, it uses the current block number as a seed, which is known to be predictable and manipulable by miners. This can lead to a predictable outcome and potential exploitation.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have explicit mechanisms to prevent front-running attacks, such as timestamp checks or transaction ordering dependencies.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps or time-dependent operations, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not perform any off-chain operations or use any client-side data, so it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the contract does not have significant vulnerabilities, but it lacks some important security measures such as access control and randomness generation. It is recommended to implement additional security measures to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
