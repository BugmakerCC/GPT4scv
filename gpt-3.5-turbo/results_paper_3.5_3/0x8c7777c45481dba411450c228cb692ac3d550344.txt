Upon reviewing the smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: The `CashOut` function allows users to withdraw funds from their balance. However, it does not update the user's balance before making the external call to `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This can allow an attacker to repeatedly call the `CashOut` function and potentially drain the contract's balance before the balance update occurs.

2. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism implemented in the contract. Any address can call the `Deposit` and `CashOut` functions, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the contract's functionality.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not have explicit checks for integer overflow and underflow when updating the balances. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not check the return value of the external call in the `CashOut` function. This can result in a silent failure if the external call fails.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit checks, which can potentially allow an attacker to perform a Denial of Service attack by consuming all the available gas in a single transaction.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any mechanism to generate random numbers, which can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the outcome of certain operations.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any protection against front-running attacks, which can occur when an attacker observes pending transactions and attempts to manipulate the order of execution to their advantage.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses the `now` keyword to get the current timestamp, which can be manipulated by miners. This can lead to vulnerabilities if the contract relies on the accuracy of timestamps for certain operations.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any protection against short address attacks, which can occur when an attacker sends a transaction with a shorter address that is not properly checked, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

It is recommended to address these vulnerabilities to ensure the security and robustness of the smart contract.
