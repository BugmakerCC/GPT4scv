Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, there are several vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: The `CashOut` function is susceptible to reentrancy attacks. The `if` statement checks if the balance is sufficient and if the current block number is greater than the last block. However, the state is updated after the external call to `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`, allowing a malicious contract to call back into this function before the balance update, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

2. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism implemented in the contract. Anyone can call the `Deposit` and `CashOut` functions, allowing unauthorized users to interact with the contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not handle potential arithmetic overflow or underflow. This can lead to unintended consequences when performing calculations, potentially resulting in incorrect balances or unexpected behavior.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The return value of the external call in the `CashOut` function is not checked. If the call to `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` fails, the contract will continue executing and deduct the balance, leading to a loss of funds with no indication of failure.

5. Denial of Service: There are no gas limits set for the execution of the contract functions. This can allow an attacker to consume excessive gas, potentially leading to a denial of service by exhausting the contract's gas limit.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not include any mechanism for generating secure random numbers. This can be exploited by attackers to predict or manipulate the outcomes of any random operations.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not implement any measures to prevent front-running attacks. Front-running can occur when an attacker observes pending transactions and intentionally reorders their own transactions to exploit a time-of-check vs time-of-use vulnerability.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract relies on the `now` keyword for timestamp calculations. However, the timestamp can be manipulated by miners to some extent, potentially allowing them to influence contract behavior.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any explicit checks for short address attacks. This vulnerability occurs when a malicious user manipulates the length of their address to exploit poorly implemented parsing functions.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the following steps can be taken:

- Implement a proper access control mechanism to restrict function calls to authorized users.
- Use safe arithmetic libraries or implement explicit checks for potential overflow or underflow conditions.
- Check the return values of low-level calls and handle failures appropriately.
- Set gas limits for the execution of contract functions to prevent denial of service attacks.
- Implement a secure random number generation mechanism.
- Use techniques like mutexes or other ordering mechanisms to prevent front-running attacks.
- Consider using block timestamps instead of relying solely on `now` for time-based calculations.
- Implement checks to ensure that all addresses passed to the contract have the correct length to prevent short address attacks.

By addressing these vulnerabilities, the smart contract can be made more secure and resilient to potential attacks.
