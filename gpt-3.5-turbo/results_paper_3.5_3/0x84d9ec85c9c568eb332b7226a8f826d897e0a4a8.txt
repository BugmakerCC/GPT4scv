Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any external calls to other contracts, so there is no direct risk of reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract has an "onlyOwner" modifier that restricts certain functions to be called only by the contract owner. This provides some level of access control.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic calculations in the contract, so there is no risk of integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not have any low-level calls, so there is no risk of unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any functionality that could lead to a denial of service attack.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any randomness-related functionality.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any sensitive operations that could be front-run.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on block timestamps for any critical operations.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any external function calls that could be vulnerable to a short address attack.

Overall, the smart contract does not seem to have any of the mentioned vulnerabilities. However, it is always recommended to perform a thorough security audit before deploying any smart contract to ensure its security.
