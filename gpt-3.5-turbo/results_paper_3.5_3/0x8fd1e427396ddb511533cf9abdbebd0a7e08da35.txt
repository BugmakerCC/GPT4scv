Here are the vulnerabilities found in the given smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability occurs when a contract allows an external contract to call back into its function before the first call is completed. In the given contract, there is no explicit use of external calls, so this vulnerability is not present.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the "onlyOwner" modifier to restrict certain functions to be called only by the contract owner. However, there is a redundancy in the "owner" declaration and assignment in the "Token" contract. This redundancy can lead to confusion and potential access control issues.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the given contract, so this vulnerability is not present.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract uses the "call" function to execute a low-level transfer of tokens in the "WithdrawToken" function. However, it does not check the return value of the "call" function, which can lead to a failure in transferring tokens without any indication.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit code that can lead to denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any randomness-related code, so this vulnerability is not present.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any explicit code that can lead to front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not have any explicit dependencies on timestamps, so this vulnerability is not present.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any explicit code that can be vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the given contract has some access control issues and lacks proper handling of return values for low-level calls, which can be potential vulnerabilities.
