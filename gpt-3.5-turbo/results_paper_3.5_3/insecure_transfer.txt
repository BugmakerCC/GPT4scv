After analyzing the provided smart contract, I have identified the following vulnerabilities:

1. Integer Overflow: The function `transfer` does not include any checks to prevent integer overflow or underflow when updating the balanceOf mappings. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large value, causing the balance to wrap around and potentially giving them a large balance.

2. Access Control: The smart contract does not implement any access control mechanisms. As a result, anyone can call the `transfer` function and modify the balances of any address.

To address these vulnerabilities, you should consider implementing the following changes:

1. Integer Overflow: Use the SafeMath library to perform arithmetic operations on the balances to prevent integer overflow and underflow. The SafeMath library provides functions like `add` and `sub` that handle these cases.

2. Access Control: Implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can call the `transfer` function. You can use modifiers to check if the sender has the necessary permissions or implement a role-based access control system.

Here's an updated version of the smart contract that addresses these vulnerabilities:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

import "./SafeMath.sol";

contract IntegerOverflowAdd {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf;

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public {
        /* Check if sender has balance */
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender].sub(_value);
        
        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to].add(_value);
    }
}
```

Note: The SafeMath library is not included in the provided code. You should import and use a trusted implementation of the SafeMath library to ensure secure arithmetic operations.
