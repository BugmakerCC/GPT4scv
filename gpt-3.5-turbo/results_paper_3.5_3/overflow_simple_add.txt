Upon inspecting the provided smart contract, I have identified the following vulnerabilities:

1. Arithmetic Issues (Integer Overflow/Underflow): The `add` function in the contract performs addition between `balance` and the `deposit` parameter without checking for potential overflow or underflow. This can result in unexpected behavior and loss of funds if the `deposit` value is too large.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should implement proper checks and validation to ensure that the addition operation does not result in an overflow or underflow. One way to achieve this is by using the SafeMath library, which provides safer arithmetic operations.

Here's an updated version of the contract with SafeMath applied:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.4.25;

library SafeMath {
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 c = a + b;
        require(c >= a, "Addition overflow");
        return c;
    }
}

contract Overflow_Add {
    using SafeMath for uint256;
    uint public balance = 1;

    function add(uint256 deposit) public {
        balance = balance.add(deposit);
    }
}
```

By using SafeMath's `add` function, we ensure that the addition cannot result in overflow or underflow.

Please note that this solution only addresses the identified vulnerability. Other vulnerabilities mentioned in the original request might still be present in the contract and need to be addressed separately.
