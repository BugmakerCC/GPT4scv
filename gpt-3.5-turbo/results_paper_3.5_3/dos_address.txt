After analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities it contains:

1. Denial of Service (Gas Limit Reached):
   - The `emptyCreditors` function can be used to cause a denial of service attack by emptying the `creditorAddresses` array when it exceeds a certain length (1500 in this case). This can consume a large amount of gas and potentially reach the gas limit, preventing other transactions from being processed.

2. Denial of Service (Access Control Breached):
   - There is no access control mechanism in place for the `emptyCreditors` function. Anyone can call this function and trigger the denial of service attack.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, you should consider implementing the following changes:

1. Gas Limit Reached:
   - Instead of emptying the `creditorAddresses` array in one go, split the operation into multiple transactions or batches to avoid reaching the gas limit. For example, you can limit the number of addresses removed per transaction.

2. Access Control:
   - Implement access control mechanisms, such as using the `onlyOwner` modifier, to restrict the execution of the `emptyCreditors` function to only authorized users.

Remember to thoroughly test the modified contract to ensure that the vulnerabilities have been effectively addressed.
