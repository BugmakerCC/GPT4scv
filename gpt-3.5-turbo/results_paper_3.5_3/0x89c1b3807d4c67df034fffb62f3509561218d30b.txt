Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the nine common vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not contain any external calls to other contracts, so there is no risk of reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any explicit access control mechanisms. It allows anyone to call the request, deliver, and cancel functions. This could potentially be a vulnerability if there are sensitive operations or data in the contract that should only be accessed by specific addresses.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract that could result in integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses low-level calls to transfer funds to the SGX_ADDRESS and callbackAddr addresses. However, it does not check the return values of these calls, which could potentially result in funds being lost or the callback function not being executed properly.

5. Denial of Service: There are no explicit denial of service vulnerabilities in the contract. However, the contract does not have any gas limit checks or mechanisms to prevent unexpected throws or kills, which could potentially result in denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not generate or use any random numbers, so there are no vulnerabilities related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not contain any critical sections or time-dependent operations that could be exploited for front-running attacks.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not have any timestamp-dependent operations, so there are no vulnerabilities related to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any off-chain or client vulnerabilities that could be exploited through a short address attack.

Overall, the contract does not appear to have any major vulnerabilities based on the nine common vulnerabilities listed. However, it does lack some important security features such as access control and checking return values for low-level calls, which could potentially lead to security issues.
