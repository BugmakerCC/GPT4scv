Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the vulnerabilities mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any explicit external calls that could lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities.

2. Access Control: There is no explicit access control mechanism in place. Any address can call the `Put` and `Collect` functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the contract that could lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low Level Calls: The contract does not have any low-level calls that need to be checked for return values.

5. Denial of Service: There are no explicit denial of service vulnerabilities in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not involve any transaction ordering or race condition vulnerabilities.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses the `now` keyword for time-based checks, which is generally safe.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not involve any off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract does not appear to have any significant vulnerabilities. However, it is always recommended to review and test the contract thoroughly to ensure its security.
