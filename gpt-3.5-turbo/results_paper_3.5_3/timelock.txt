After reviewing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: The contract seems to be safe from reentrancy attacks as it follows the best practice of updating the state variables before making any external calls.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any explicit access control mechanisms. This means that anyone can deposit, increase lock time, and withdraw funds. It is recommended to implement access control to restrict certain functions to authorized users only.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not use any low-level calls (e.g., `call`, `delegatecall`, `send`, `transfer`) where the return value is not checked. So, this vulnerability is not present.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any explicit denial of service vulnerabilities, such as gas limit reached, unexpected throw, or access control breaches.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any random number generation or rely on randomness, so this vulnerability is not applicable.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any explicit front-running vulnerabilities or transaction ordering dependence issues.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses the `now` keyword to determine the lock time. This can be manipulated by miners to some extent, as they can control the block timestamp. It is recommended to use a more secure and tamper-resistant source of time, such as block numbers.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any explicit short address attack vulnerabilities or off-chain issues.

Overall, the contract seems to be relatively secure, but it lacks access control and uses `now` for lock time, which can be improved upon.
