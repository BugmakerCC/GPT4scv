Here is an analysis of the given smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: There is no external call to another contract, so this vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract.

2. Access Control: The contract has an `owner` variable, but there is no mechanism to control access to the `set` and `withdraw` functions. Anyone can call these functions, which can be a security risk. Consider implementing access controls to restrict who can call these functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the provided code, so this vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: There are no low-level calls (e.g., `call`, `delegatecall`, etc.) in the given smart contract, so this vulnerability is not present.

5. Denial of Service: The `set` function does not perform any complex operations that could lead to a denial of service, so this vulnerability is not present.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness, so this vulnerability is not present.

7. Front-Running: The code does not involve any sensitive operations that can be front-run, so this vulnerability is not present.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on the timestamp or time-sensitive operations, so this vulnerability is not present.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not involve any external calls, so this vulnerability is not present.

Overall, the most significant vulnerability in the given smart contract is the lack of access control, which allows anyone to call the `set` and `withdraw` functions. It is recommended to implement access controls to restrict these functions to authorized users only.
