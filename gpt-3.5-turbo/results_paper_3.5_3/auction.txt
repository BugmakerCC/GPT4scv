Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack: The `DosAuction` contract is susceptible to a DoS attack. An attacker can repeatedly bid with a fallback function that reverts, preventing other participants from outbidding. This is because the refund to the previous frontrunner is done before updating the frontrunner and current bid.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the refund should be done after updating the frontrunner and current bid.

Here is the modified code with the vulnerability fixed:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.15;

//Auction susceptible to DoS attack
contract DosAuction {
  address currentFrontrunner;
  uint currentBid;

  //Takes in bid, refunding the frontrunner if they are outbid
  function bid() payable {
    require(msg.value > currentBid);

    address previousFrontrunner = currentFrontrunner;
    uint previousBid = currentBid;

    currentFrontrunner = msg.sender;
    currentBid = msg.value;

    //Refund the previous frontrunner after updating the frontrunner and current bid
    if (previousFrontrunner != 0) {
      require(previousFrontrunner.send(previousBid));
    }
  }
}
```

By moving the refund after updating the frontrunner and current bid, the vulnerability is mitigated.

Please note that this fix addresses the DoS vulnerability, but the contract may still have other vulnerabilities. It is important to conduct a thorough security assessment to identify and mitigate all potential vulnerabilities.
