Here is an analysis of the provided smart contract for the vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract uses a modifier `onlyowner` to restrict access to the `withdraw` function. This is a basic form of access control, but it is missing the constructor to set the initial owner. It should be noted that the constructor has a different name than the contract, which could lead to confusion, but it does not pose a security vulnerability.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in this contract, so it is not vulnerable to arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: There are no low-level calls (`call`, `delegatecall`, `send`, etc.) in this contract, so there are no unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any obvious denial of service vulnerabilities.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness issues.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not involve any transactions that could be front-run, so it is not vulnerable to front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps or time-dependent logic, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any external calls that could be vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the contract does not exhibit any of the vulnerabilities you mentioned. However, it is worth noting that the constructor has a different name than the contract, which can lead to confusion and should be fixed for clarity.
