Here is the analysis of the Rubixi smart contract for the nine common vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls, so there is no direct risk of reentrancy vulnerability.

2. Access Control: The contract uses a modifier "onlyowner" to restrict certain functions to be called only by the contract creator. This provides basic access control.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow. The only arithmetic operation is the multiplication in the addPayout function, which does not pose a risk in this case.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls to external contracts, so there is no risk of unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any code that could lead to denial of service attacks.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any random number generation, so there is no risk of bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any code that could lead to front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical functionality, so there is no risk of time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any code that could be susceptible to short address attacks.

Overall, the Rubixi smart contract does not seem to have any of the mentioned vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that this analysis is based on the provided code and may not cover all possible attack vectors. It is always recommended to conduct a thorough security audit before deploying any smart contract.
