The provided smart contract does not contain any of the nine common vulnerabilities mentioned. However, there are a few issues that could be improved:

1. Typo: "sudicideAnyone" should be corrected to "suicideAnyone" in the function name.

2. Lack of visibility specifier: The function `suicideAnyone` does not have a visibility specifier. It is recommended to explicitly specify the visibility of functions to make the code more readable and avoid potential issues.

Here is the updated version of the smart contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract SimpleSuicide {
    function suicideAnyone() public {
        selfdestruct(msg.sender);
    }
}
```

Please note that this updated version does not contain any of the mentioned vulnerabilities, but it is still a simple example and may not cover all possible security concerns.
