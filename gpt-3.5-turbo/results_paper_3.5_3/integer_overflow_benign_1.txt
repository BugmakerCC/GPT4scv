Based on the given smart contract, here is the analysis for the nine common vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract as there are no external calls.

2. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism implemented in the given smart contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: This vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract as there are no arithmetic operations that can cause overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: This vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract as there are no low-level calls (e.g., call, delegatecall) made.

5. Denial of Service: This vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract as there are no gas limit reached scenarios or unexpected throw/kill/access control breaches.

6. Bad Randomness: This vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract as there are no random number generation or secret information involved.

7. Front-Running: This vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract as there are no scenarios where transaction ordering can be exploited.

8. Time Manipulation: This vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract as there are no dependencies on the timestamp.

9. Short Address Attack: This vulnerability is not present in the given smart contract as there are no off-chain interactions or client vulnerabilities.

Overall, the given smart contract does not exhibit any of the mentioned vulnerabilities.
