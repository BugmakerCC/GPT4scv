Upon analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any functions that make external calls, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract has an "onlyowner" modifier, which restricts certain functions to be only called by the owner. This is a basic form of access control, but it does not prevent other potential vulnerabilities related to access control.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract, so it is not vulnerable to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: There are no low-level calls (e.g., "call" or "delegatecall") in the contract, so it is not vulnerable to unchecked return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any operations that could lead to a denial of service attack.

6. Bad Randomness: There are no random number generation operations in the contract, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any operations that could be front-run by miners or other participants in the network.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for any critical functionality, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any functions that accept variable-length data, so it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.

Overall, the provided smart contract does not appear to have any significant vulnerabilities. However, it is worth noting that the constructor should be named "Missing" to match the contract name for clarity and best practices.
