Here is an analysis of the smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls to other contracts, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract uses a simple Owner variable to control access to certain functions. However, the Owner variable can be changed through the "withdraw" function, which is not properly protected. This makes the contract vulnerable to unauthorized access.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit arithmetic operations in the contract, so it is not vulnerable to arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low Level Calls: The contract uses a low-level call in the "Command" function, but it does not check the return value. This could lead to silent failures if the called contract reverts or throws an exception.

5. Denial of Service: There are no gas limit related issues or unexpected throw/kill in the contract. However, the "withdraw" function can be called by anyone, which may lead to unauthorized funds withdrawal.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not involve any randomness, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any critical state changes that can be front-run.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps for critical operations, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not involve any off-chain interactions, so it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.

In summary, the contract is vulnerable to access control issues and unchecked return values for low-level calls. The "withdraw" function should be modified to enforce proper access control, and the return value of the low-level call in the "Command" function should be checked to handle potential failures.
