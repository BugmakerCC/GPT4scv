After analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities I have identified:

1. Reentrancy: The `resetInvestment()` function in the `Governmental` contract does not have proper checks to prevent reentrancy attacks. The `lastInvestor.send(jackpot)` line should be moved to the end of the function to mitigate this vulnerability.

2. Access Control: The `Governmental` contract does not have any access control mechanisms. Any address can call the `invest()` and `resetInvestment()` functions, which can lead to unauthorized actions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not handle potential arithmetic overflow and underflow issues. For example, the line `jackpot += msg.value/2` does not check for potential overflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not check the return values of the `send()` function calls in the `resetInvestment()` function. This can lead to silent failures if the `send()` calls fail.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limit checks, which can allow an attacker to consume all the gas in a block, leading to a Denial of Service attack.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any mechanism to generate random numbers, which can be exploited by an attacker to predict outcomes or manipulate the contract's behavior.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any mechanisms to prevent front-running attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses the `block.timestamp` to check the time difference, which can be manipulated by miners to their advantage.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not handle the potential issue of short address attacks, where an attacker can craft a transaction with a short address to exploit vulnerabilities in the contract.

To make the contract more secure, you should consider implementing proper access control mechanisms, performing checks for potential arithmetic issues, handling return values of low-level calls, implementing gas limit checks, using a secure source of randomness, mitigating front-running attacks, using a more secure method for time manipulation, and handling the possibility of short address attacks.
