The given smart contract is susceptible to an Integer Overflow vulnerability. 

In the `init` function, the `map` mapping is updated by subtracting the value `v` from the existing value at key `k`. However, if the subtraction operation results in an overflow, the result will wrap around and lead to an unintended value being stored in the mapping.

To fix this vulnerability, you can add a check to ensure that the subtraction operation does not result in an overflow. One way to do this is by using the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations.

Here's an updated version of the smart contract using SafeMath:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.11;

import "github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol";

contract IntegerOverflowMappingSym1 {
    using SafeMath for uint256;
    
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) map;

    function init(uint256 k, uint256 v) public {
        require(v <= map[k]); // Prevent underflow
        
        map[k] = map[k].sub(v);
    }
}
```

In the updated version, the `SafeMath` library is imported, and the `sub` function is used to subtract `v` from `map[k]`. Additionally, a `require` statement is added to ensure that `v` is not greater than `map[k]`, preventing an underflow.
