After carefully reviewing the smart contract provided, here are the vulnerabilities that I have identified:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks as it allows external contracts to call the `Collect` function. When `Collect` transfers funds to `msg.sender`, it should be the last operation to prevent reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms implemented. This means that anyone can call the `Put` and `Collect` functions, potentially manipulating the contract's state.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no explicit checks for integer overflow or underflow in the contract. Operations such as `acc.balance += msg.value` and `acc.balance -= _am` can potentially lead to arithmetic issues if not properly handled.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses the `call` function without checking the return value. If the call to `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` fails, the contract does not handle the failure and continues execution, leading to the potential loss of funds.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any gas limits or checks for gas exhaustion. This can allow an attacker to consume all the gas, preventing other transactions from being executed.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not have any mechanisms to ensure randomness. This can lead to predictable outcomes in functions such as `Put`, which rely on random values.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any measures to prevent front-running attacks. A malicious user could observe pending transactions and manipulate their own transaction order to gain an advantage.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses the `now` keyword to check for time-based conditions. However, `now` can be manipulated by miners to bypass certain conditions, potentially leading to unauthorized operations.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not have any checks for short address attacks. If a caller provides a short address, it can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

It is important to address these vulnerabilities to ensure the security and reliability of the smart contract.
