The given smart contract seems to have some vulnerabilities. Here they are:

1. Reentrancy: The function `sendMoney` uses a low level `call` function to send ether to a target address. This can potentially lead to a reentrancy attack if the target address is a malicious contract. The attacker can fallback to the `sendMoney` function and drain the contract.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `call` function in `sendMoney` doesn't check the return value. If it fails for some reason (like the receiver throws an error), the contract will not be aware of the failure.

3. Access Control: Although the contract seems to have access control in place using the `onlyOwner` modifier, if the ownership of the contract is compromised, the attacker can drain the contract.

4. Denial of Service: The `withdrawAll` function could potentially cause a DOS attack. If the `owner` address is a contract, and it's fallback function throws an error, the `withdrawAll` function will get stuck as it's trying to send all the balance to an address that's refusing it.

The contract doesn't seem to have Arithmetic Issues, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, and Short Address Attack vulnerabilities. However, it's important to note that without the full context and usage of the contract, it's possible that some vulnerabilities might be overlooked. For example, Front-Running vulnerabilities generally involve some external actors and off-chain actions.
