Upon analyzing the given smart contract, the following vulnerabilities were detected:

1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**: The 'Collect' function in the 'DEP_BANK' contract is potentially vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The 'Collect' function sends Ether with 'msg.sender.call.value(_am)()' before it updates the balance of the sender with 'balances[msg.sender]-=_am;'. This could allow an attacker to repeatedly enter the function and drain the contract's funds before their balance is updated.

2. **Access Control Vulnerability**: The 'SetMinSum', 'SetLogFile' and 'Initialized' functions in the 'DEP_BANK' contract do not have any access control mechanisms implemented. This means that any address can call these functions and potentially disrupt the contract's normal operations.

3. **Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls Vulnerability**: The return value of the low-level call 'msg.sender.call.value(_am)()' in the 'Collect' function is not checked. If this call fails for any reason, the contract's state would still be modified.

The contract does seem to be free from the other vulnerabilities mentioned like Arithmetic Issues, Denial of Service, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, Short Address Attack.

However, please note that this is a basic analysis and the contract should undergo a thorough security audit before being deployed.
