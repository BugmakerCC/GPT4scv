The following vulnerabilities could be present in the given smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The `redeem` function could be vulnerable to a reentrancy attack, as it calls the `transfer` function before the state of the contract changes. A malicious contract could possibly take control of the contract and drain all its funds.

2. Access Control: The `withdraw` function changes the contract owner if the sender is a specific address, this could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the contract. The `Command` function also allows the owner to execute arbitrary code which could be abused by an attacker if they gain control of the contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract doesn't seem to have any arithmetic operations, thus it doesn't seem to be vulnerable to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `Command` function uses a low level call which could potentially fail silently as it doesn't check the return value.

5. Denial of Service: The contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to this kind of attack.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract doesn't generate any random numbers, thus it doesn't seem to be vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract doesn't seem to have any state changes that could be front-run.

8. Time manipulation: The contract doesn't use timestamps or block numbers, thus it doesn't seem to be vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to this kind of attack as it doesn't take any address inputs from external sources.

Please note that this analysis is not exhaustive and the contract could potentially have other vulnerabilities. It's always a good idea to have your contracts audited by a professional security firm.
