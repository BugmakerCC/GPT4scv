1. Bad Randomness: `shuffle()` function uses `now` and blockhash for generating random number which can be influenced by miners. This is a critical issue.

2. Reentrancy: In the `play()` function, the winner is allowed to withdraw the contract's balance. However, the state variable `secretNumber` is only updated after the transfer function. If the fallback function of the sender's contract triggers another `play()` function within the same transaction, it can drain the contract's balance.

3. Denial of Service: The `kill()` function can make the contract useless when the owner calls it after 1 day of the last played game. This can be used to lock the funds of the players.

4. Access Control: The `kill()` function can only be accessed by the contract's owner, but there's no function for changing the ownership. If the owner loses access to their account, the contract can't be killed.

5. Front-Running: Since the secret number is generated based on the information in the blockchain, a miner could potentially manipulate the transaction order to win the game.

6. Time Manipulation: This contract relies on the `now` keyword for multiple operations. A miner could potentially influence the timestamp of the block to their advantage.

7. Arithmetic Issues: There isn't any overflow or underflow checks in the contract.

8. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `transfer` function does not check for its return value. If it fails, the contract will not be aware.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract does not verify the length of the address which could lead to a short address attack.
