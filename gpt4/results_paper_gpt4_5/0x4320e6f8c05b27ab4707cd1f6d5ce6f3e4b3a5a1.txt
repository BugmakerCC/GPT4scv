The given smart contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `Collect(uint _am)` is susceptible to a reentrancy attack because it calls an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`) before it updates the state (`balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`). An attacker can recursively call the `Collect` function before the state `balances[msg.sender]` is updated, draining the contract of Ether.

2. Access Control: There are no access control checks for the `SetMinSum(uint _val)`, `SetLogFile(address _log)`, and `Initialized()` functions. This means any address can call these functions, potentially leading the contract into an undesired state. For example, an attacker could constantly change the `LogFile` address, causing confusion and potential loss of data.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not check for overflows or underflows when updating the balances. This could potentially lead to integer overflow/underflow issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values: The return value of the external call (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`) in the `Collect` function is not checked. If this call fails, the contract's state would still be updated, causing a discrepancy between the actual and expected balances.

5. Denial of Service (DoS): The `Collect` function can be blocked by a malicious contract refusing to receive Ether, thereby locking funds in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable in this contract.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable in this contract.

8. Time Manipulation: The `LogFile` contract uses `now` for timestamping. This can be manipulated by miners up to a certain degree and can cause discrepancies in the order of transactions.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable in this contract.

To improve this contract, consider implementing access control mechanisms, reentrancy guards, safe math libraries to prevent arithmetic issues, and check the return value of external calls. Also, consider alternative methods for timestamping to prevent possible miner manipulation.
