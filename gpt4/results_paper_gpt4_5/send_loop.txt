This smart contract has several potential vulnerabilities. 

1. Denial of Service (DoS): The `refundAll` function is vulnerable to a DoS attack. If one of the send operations fails, the transaction will be reverted, and the whole operation will fail. This means that a single failure can block all funds.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `send` function is used without checking the return value. While the `require` statement does check for failure, it can lead to a DoS attack as mentioned above. It's generally safer to use the `transfer` method instead of `send`.

3. Access Control: There seems to be no access control mechanism in place. Any address can call the `refundAll` function which could lead to unauthorized transactions.

4. Reentrancy: Although this contract does not call external contracts, if it did, reentrancy could be a potential issue. This is because a called contract could call back (re-enter) the original contract before the first invocation of the function was finished.

The other vulnerabilities you mentioned (Arithmetic Issues, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, Short Address Attack) are not directly visible in this contract but could potentially appear in more complex contracts or depending on how this contract is used. Therefore, it's always important to consider all these vulnerabilities when writing or reviewing smart contracts.
