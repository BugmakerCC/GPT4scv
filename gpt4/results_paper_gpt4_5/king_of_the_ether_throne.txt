After analyzing the provided smart contract, I have identified the following potential vulnerabilities:

1. **Reentrancy**: The contract has a potential reentrancy vulnerability due to the use of `send()` function in lines 102, 107, 132, and 160. In these lines, external calls are made before the contract state is properly updated, and if the called contract has a fallback function, reentrancy could occur.

2. **Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls**: The return value of `send()` function is not checked in the contract. If a `send()` function fails and returns `false`, the contract does not handle this situation which can lead to unexpected behavior.

3. **Arithmetic Issues**: The contract does not use SafeMath library or similar precautions while performing arithmetic operations. This could lead to potential integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities.

4. **Access Control**: The contract has an `onlywizard` modifier to restrict some functions to the wizard only. But if the wizard's private key is compromised, the attacker can take control over the contract.

5. **Denial of Service**: If the current monarch's address is a contract which has a fallback function that always throws an exception, it can block the `claimThrone` function at line 132, resulting in a Denial of Service.

6. **Front-Running**: Since Ethereum miners can see transactions before they  re confirmed, they can put their transactions ahead of others. This could potentially affect the outcome of `claimThrone` function.

7. **Time Manipulation**: This contract uses `block.timestamp` for setting the `coronationTimestamp` of a monarch. Miners have the ability to manipulate this value to a certain degree.

8. **Short Address Attack**: The contract does not validate the length of the address which might lead to a short address attack.

Please note that the contract does not seem to have issues related to "Bad Randomness" and there are no off-chain computations or external data references, so there doesn't seem to be an issue with "Nothing is Secret". 

The provided analysis should not be considered exhaustive and a thorough security audit by a professional security auditor is recommended before using this contract in a production environment.
