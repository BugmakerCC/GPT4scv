This smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `Collect(uint _am)` is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. Inside this function, the contract sends Ether to an address using `call.value()()`. This method forwards all available gas (except for a stipend of 2300 gas which is not enough to perform a state change) to the external contract, which means that the external contract can perform a significant amount of computation including calling back into the calling contract before the `call.value()()` method returns. The contract then subtracts `_am` from `balances[msg.sender]`. If the external contract calls back into `Collect(uint _am)`, this could result in `balances[msg.sender]` being subtracted multiple times, allowing the attacker to drain Ether from the contract.

2. Access Control: The contract has no access control checks, meaning anyone can call its public functions. For example, anyone can call `SetMinSum(uint _val)` and `SetLogFile(address _log)`, potentially disrupting the contract's normal operation.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no checks for integer overflow or underflow. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if large or small values are used.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The return value of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is not checked, which means that if the call fails for any reason, the contract will not be aware of it.

5. Denial of Service: If an attacker sets the `LogFile` address to a contract that throws an exception in `AddMessage`, this could prevent users from making deposits or collecting their balances, effectively causing a denial of service.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable as the contract does not use randomness.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable as the contract does not use transaction ordering.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) in `AddMessage`. Miners can slightly manipulate this value.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable as the contract does not take address inputs from transaction senders.
