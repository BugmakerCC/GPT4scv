This smart contract seems to have at least two potential vulnerabilities based on the provided list:

1. Reentrancy: The function `CashOut(uint _am)` is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The contract sends ether with `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` before it reduces the balance with `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`. An attacker could create a fallback function on their contract to call `CashOut` again before the first `CashOut` call has finished, potentially draining the contract of more ether than they should be able to according to their balance.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: In the `CashOut(uint _am)` function, there is a call to a low level function `call.value()`, the return value of this call is not checked. If this call fails the execution will continue without throwing an exception. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

Please note that these vulnerabilities can be mitigated. For instance, the reentrancy vulnerability can be mitigated by using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, where you would first perform any checks (e.g., require statements), then make any changes to the state, and lastly interact with other contracts. The return value check can be added to ensure the `call.value()` function was successful.
