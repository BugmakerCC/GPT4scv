Here are the potential vulnerabilities detected in the provided smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: No reentrancy vulnerability seems to be present in this contract. However, it's important to note that the contract makes use of a low level call which could potentially be a point of reentrancy if not handled properly.

2. Access Control: There are no restrictions on who can call the 'transfer' function. Anyone can execute it which may be a security issue depending on the context.

3. Arithmetic Issues: This contract doesn't have any arithmetic operations, so it's free from any arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The return value of the 'call' function is not checked, this can lead to silent failing sends.

5. Denial of Service: No explicit signs of Denial of Service vulnerabilities were found, but the 'transfer' function could potentially run out of gas if _tos.length is very large.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness, so there is no bad randomness issue.

7. Front-Running: There doesn't appear to be a front-running vulnerability in this contract.

8. Time manipulation: There is no dependence on time or block variables in this contract, so it's free from time manipulation issues.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not validate the length of the input addresses, so it could be vulnerable to short address attacks. 

Overall, the code should be revised to handle the potential issues with unchecked return values, unrestricted access control, potential gas limit issues, and possible short address attacks. It's always a good practice to perform a thorough audit of the smart contract before deployment to ensure its security.
