Here are some of the vulnerabilities detected in the provided smart contract:

1. Bad Randomness: The `rand` function is supposed to generate a random number. However, it uses `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` for randomness, which is predictable and can be manipulated by miners. This vulnerability could lead to a biased and predictable lottery system.

2. Reentrancy: The contract uses the `send()` function to transfer Ether. This method forwards only a limited gas stipend, thus guarding against reentrancy. However, it's worth noting that if the execution of the fallback function of the receiver contract requires more than 2300 gas (the stipend forwarded by `send()`), the `send()` call will fail.

3. Access Control: The contract uses a simple check `if (msg.sender == owner) _;` to restrict access to owner-only functions. This could be vulnerable to potential impersonation attacks if the owner's private key is compromised. Using a more secure access control mechanism could help mitigate this threat.

4. Denial of Service: The contract could fall victim to a denial of service attack. If a malicious actor creates a contract that always fails in its fallback function, and that contract participates in LuckyDoubler, it could prevent other participants from getting paid.

5. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses `send()` function multiple times to transfer ethers, but it does not check the return value of `send()`. If `send()` fails, the contract will continue executing, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

6. Arithmetic Issues: Potential for integer underflow and overflow in arithmetic operations. Solidity does not handle these cases natively, and the contract does not implement any form of safe math to prevent these errors. 

7. Front-Running: Since Ethereum miners can see transactions before they are included in the block, they can potentially influence the `rand` function outcome by deciding whether to include a transaction in the block or not.

8. Time manipulation: The contract is vulnerable to time manipulation attacks as it relies on `block.number - 1` to generate a random number.

9. The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to the Short Address Attack as it does not manipulate `msg.data` directly.

Please note that the above analysis is based on the provided contract code and the mentioned common vulnerabilities. The actual impact and the vulnerability might change with the complete understanding of the business logic and use case of the contract.
