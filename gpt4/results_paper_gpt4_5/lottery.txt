The smart contract provided for inspection has several potential vulnerabilities associated with the nine common vulnerabilities you mentioned:

1. Reentrancy: This contract doesn't seem to have an explicit Reentrancy vulnerability. However, the `makeBet()` function, which sends Ether, could potentially be a source of Reentrancy if it was called by another contract.

2. Access Control: The contract does have access controls to some functions like `getBets()` and `destroy()`. However, these are poorly implemented as they only check if the sender is the organizer, allowing any user to call other functions such as `makeBet()`.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There doesn't seem to be a risk of integer overflow or underflow in this contract as no arithmetic operations are performed on large integers.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The smart contract does check the return value of `send()`, it throws an exception if it fails.

5. Denial of Service (DoS): The contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to DoS attacks. 

6. Bad Randomness: The contract is highly vulnerable to bad randomness as it uses `block.number % 2` as a source of randomness which is predictable and can easily be manipulated by miners.

7. Front-Running: Front-running attacks could potentially affect this contract. An attacker could observe the pending transactions and then place a bet based on the predicted outcome.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract is vulnerable to time manipulation as it relies on `block.number` for its functionality.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack as it doesn't take address inputs from users.

It's recommended that the contract owner should address these issues to improve the security of the contract.
