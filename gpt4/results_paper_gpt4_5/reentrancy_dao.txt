The provided smart contract has a Reentrancy vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs when the contract's state is altered after an external call. 

In the `withdrawAll` function, the contract sends Ether before setting `credit[msg.sender]` to 0. This allows the receiver of the Ether to call the contract again before `credit[msg.sender]` is set to 0. If the receiver is a malicious contract, it can exploit this to drain the contract of all its Ether. 

Here is how this may happen: 

1. Malicious contract deposits 1 Ether to the contract
2. Malicious contract calls `withdrawAll`
3. The contract sends 1 Ether to the malicious contract
4. The malicious contract's fallback function is executed, which calls `withdrawAll` again
5. The contract sends 1 Ether to the malicious contract again
6. This repeats until the contract is drained of all its Ether

To fix this, `credit[msg.sender]` should be set to 0 before calling `msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)()`. 

The rest of the vulnerabilities (Access Control, Arithmetic Issues, Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls, Denial of Service, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, Short Address Attack) are not present in the contract.
