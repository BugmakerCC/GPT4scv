The provided smart contract seems to exhibit the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: In the Get() function, the contract is transferring ether to 'msg.sender' after transferring the contract's balance to the owner. If the 'msg.sender' is a contract, it can call back into the Get() function before the first call to Get() has finished, resulting in a reentrancy attack. This could drain the contract's ether.

2. Access Control: The contract's owner is public and can be changed via the withdraw() function by a specific address hardcoded in the function. This is a critical vulnerability since the owner has control over the contract's balance.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: Low-level call is used in Command() function and the return value of the call is not checked. If the call fails, the contract will not be aware of it.

4. Arithmetic Issues: Not applicable in the provided contract.

5. Denial of Service: In the Get() function, if the contract's balance is greater than 1 ether, both the owner and the sender are trying to withdraw the entire balance. If the first transfer fails, the ether will be locked in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable in the provided contract.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable in the provided contract.

8. Time manipulation: Not applicable in the provided contract.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable in the provided contract. 

These are potential vulnerabilities and could be exploited by attackers. It is advised to fix these issues to secure the contract.
