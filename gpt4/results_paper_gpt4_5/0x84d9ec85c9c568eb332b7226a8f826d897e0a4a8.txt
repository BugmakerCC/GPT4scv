1. Reentrancy: The contract does not appear to be vulnerable to reentrancy as there are no external contract calls within a function.

2. Access Control: The contract appears to be vulnerable to an access control issue. The `writeIndex` function does not have any access controls, so any address can call it and potentially add incorrect or malicious data.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to arithmetic issues, as there are no arithmetic operations being performed in the contract.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract has a low level call in the `execute` function within the `Owned` contract, but it does not check the return value, potentially leading to unchecked-send vulnerability.

5. Denial of Service: There do not seem to be any vulnerabilities related to denial of service, as there are no loops or functions that could reach the gas limit or cause unexpected throws.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to bad randomness because it does not use randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not appear to be vulnerable to front-running, as there are no transaction ordering dependencies or time-of-check vs time-of-use conditions.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not appear to be vulnerable to time manipulation, as it does not rely on block timestamps or block hashes for functionality.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack, as it does not interact with user-supplied addresses in a way that would make it susceptible to such an attack. However, it's always a good practice to validate the address length. 

Overall, the most notable vulnerabilities are access control and unchecked return values for low level calls. These should be addressed to ensure the security of the contract.
