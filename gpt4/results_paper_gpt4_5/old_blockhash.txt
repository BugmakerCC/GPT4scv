This contract appears to have two main vulnerabilities related to the Weak Randomness and Time Manipulation vulnerabilities mentioned in your list. 

1. Weak Randomness (Bad Randomness): The contract's randomness is based on the block's hash which is not a secure source of randomness. An attacker could potentially manipulate or predict the block hash. 

2. Time Manipulation: The contract uses 'block.number' to determine the timing of events. This can be manipulated by miners to some extent. 

Other potential vulnerabilities could be, but not visible from the code:

1. Reentrancy: If the contract interacts with another contract in the 'settle' function, a reentrancy attack could occur. However, we can't see this vulnerability directly in the provided contract because it doesn't call an unknown contract.

2. Access Control: All functions are public and could be called by anyone. However, this might not be a vulnerability because it might be the intended behavior.

3. Arithmetic Issues: No arithmetic operations are performed in this contract, so there's no risk of overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values: The transfer function in the 'settle' function doesn't check the return value. However, this is not a problem because transfer throws an exception on failure.

5. Denial of Service: The contract doesn't seem vulnerable to a denial of service attack.

6. Front-Running: The contract might be vulnerable to front-running, because an attacker might be able to see a guess and then make their own guess based on that information.

7. Short Address Attack: The contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to short address attacks because it's not dependent on the length of addresses.
