The smart contract doesn't seem to have most of the mentioned vulnerabilities, but it does have a "Batch Overflow" vulnerability which is an arithmetic issue. The vulnerability can be found in the `batchTransfer` function, where the `amount` variable is calculated by multiplying the count of receivers (`cnt`) with the value to be transferred (`_value`). If an extremely large value of `_value` is provided, it can cause an integer overflow, making `amount` very small. 

The `require` statement that checks if the sender has sufficient balance can pass because of this small `amount` value, and in the end, the sender ends up transferring more tokens than they had in their balance.

To fix this issue, each transfer inside the loop should be checked for overflow individually, or the `_value` parameter should be checked to be less than a certain safe limit.
