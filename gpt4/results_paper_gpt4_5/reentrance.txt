This smart contract contains a Reentrancy vulnerability specifically in the `withdraw` function. 

Reentrancy occurs when a called contract (in this case `msg.sender.call.value(_amount)()`) is able to call back (re-enter) the calling contract before its execution is finished. 

Here is how it happens:

1. The contract checks if the `msg.sender` balance is greater than or equal to `_amount`.
2. Then it sends `_amount` to the `msg.sender`.
3. And only after that it reduces the `msg.sender`'s balance by `_amount`.

This is a problem because Solidity does not handle reentrant calls in a atomic (indivisible) manner, which means that after the contract sends `_amount` to `msg.sender`, but before it has a chance to reduce the `msg.sender`'s balance, the `msg.sender` can call the `withdraw` function again, and if its balance is still greater than `_amount`, it will be able to withdraw it again.

In order to mitigate the Reentrancy vulnerability, the contract should first reduce the `msg.sender`'s balance, and only then send the `_amount`:

```
  function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
    if(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount) {
      balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
      
      if(!msg.sender.call.value(_amount)()) {
        throw;
      }
    }
  }
```

Please note that the other vulnerabilities mentioned are not present in this contract.
