The smart contract has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `multiplicate` function may be subject to a reentrancy attack. If the `adr` address is a malicious contract that calls `multiplicate` in its fallback function, it can continuously drain the contract's Ether.

2. Access Control: The contract has a function `Command` which allows the owner to execute arbitrary code on any address. This is a significant security risk, as it could allow the contract owner to manipulate other contracts or accounts.

3. Arithmetic Issues: In the `multiplicate` function, the contract sends `this.balance + msg.value` to the `adr` address. If the contract's balance plus the message value exceeds the maximum value of a uint256, it could result in an integer overflow and the recipient may receive less funds than expected.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: In the `Command` function, the low level `.call()` function is used but the return value is not checked. If the call fails, the contract will not revert the transaction.

5. Denial of Service: The `multiplicate` function can be exploited so that the contract will always throw an exception when trying to transfer more Ether than it currently has, effectively blocking all future transactions.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable, as this contract does not involve any randomness.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable, as this contract does not involve any transactions that could be front-run.

8. Time Manipulation: Not applicable, as this contract does not involve any time dependent operations.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable, as this contract does not involve any operations that could be exploited for a short address attack. 

Overall, the smart contract has several vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited. It's recommended to address these issues before deploying the contract.
