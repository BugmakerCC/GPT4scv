The contract has a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to the gas limit. 

In the `ifillArray()` function, the contract is trying to add 350 addresses to the `listAddresses` array in a single transaction. This could potentially exceed the block gas limit if the array's length is large. Once the array's length is larger than about 1500, any call to `ifillArray()` would require more gas than the block gas limit, making the function uncallable and therefore freezing the contract.

In addition, this contract does not have any Access Control mechanisms, meaning that anyone can call the `ifillArray()` function and potentially cause it to reach the gas limit.

The other vulnerabilities listed (Reentrancy, Arithmetic Issues, Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, Short Address Attack) are not present in this contract.
