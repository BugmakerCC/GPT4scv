The provided smart contract is susceptible to the Arithmetic Issue, specifically Integer Overflow and Underflow. 

The vulnerability exists in the function `run()`. When this function is called with a very large `input` value, the product of `count` and `input` may exceed the maximum limit of the `uint256` data type, causing an integer overflow. Conversely, if a very small value (close to zero) is used, it could potentially lead to an integer underflow.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the `count` variable to an unexpected value, which can lead to incorrect business logic and potentially loss of funds.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should include a check to prevent integer overflow and underflow. SafeMath library in solidity provides functions for safely performing arithmetic operations.

Here is the corrected smart contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.19;

import "./SafeMath.sol"; // include SafeMath library

contract IntegerOverflowMul {
    using SafeMath for uint256; // use SafeMath for uint256

    uint256 public count = 2;

    function run(uint256 input) public {
        count = count.mul(input); // use SafeMath's mul function
    }
}
```
Here, `SafeMath`'s `mul` function is used, which includes a check for integer overflow. If an overflow is detected, it reverts the transaction, preventing the overflow.
