The given smart contract seems to be an implementation of the ERC20 token standard with the SafeMath library used for arithmetic operations. I will now analyze the contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities.

1. **Reentrancy**: This contract does not appear to make any external calls to unknown addresses, so the reentrancy vulnerability is not present.
   
2. **Access Control**: The contract does not use any access controls like onlyOwner or similar modifiers. However, considering the nature of the ERC20 token, this is not a vulnerability.

3. **Arithmetic Issues**: The contract uses the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin for all its arithmetic operations. This library ensures that operations do not overflow or underflow.

4. **Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls**: This contract does not make any low-level calls like call.value(), send() or transfer().

5. **Denial of Service**: There are no loops in the contract that can cause a denial of service due to excessive gas consumption.

6. **Bad Randomness**: This contract does not use any randomness, so this vulnerability is not present.

7. **Front-Running**: As with any ERC20 contract, front-running is possible if a malicious miner chooses to prioritize transactions. However, this is an Ethereum-wide issue, not a specific contract vulnerability.

8. **Time manipulation**: There is no use of block.timestamp or now keyword, so there is no time manipulation vulnerability.

9. **Short Address Attack**: This contract does not have any explicit protection against short address attacks. However, the risk of this attack is mostly mitigated by how Ethereum clients handle transaction input data.

In conclusion, this contract does not appear to have any of the mentioned vulnerabilities. However, it's good to note that the absence of these vulnerabilities does not mean that the contract is entirely secure. It's always recommended to conduct a thorough audit of any smart contract before usage.
