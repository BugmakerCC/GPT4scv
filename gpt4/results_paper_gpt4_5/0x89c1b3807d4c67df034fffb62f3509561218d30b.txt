The contract seems to have the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This contract has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `request` and `cancel` functions through the use of `msg.sender.call.value()`. This could allow an attacker to drain the contract of funds.

2. Access Control: The `upgrade`, `reset`, `suspend`, `restart`, and `withdraw` functions are only meant to be accessed by the original requester of the contract (stored in `requests[0].requester`). However, there are no permissions set to prevent other addresses from calling these functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are several arithmetic operations in this contract (like `requestCnt++`, `unrespondedCnt++`, `unrespondedCnt--`, `fee - CANCELLATION_FEE`) but there are no checks to prevent overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: There are several instances of low level calls (`call.value()`, `send`) which do not check the return value. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

5. Denial of Service: The `killswitch` variable can be used to halt the execution of key functions. If an attacker gains control of the `msg.sender == requests[0].requester`, they can effectively halt the contract's ability to process requests.

6. Bad Randomness: There does not appear to be any randomness in this contract.

7. Front-Running: There does not appear to be any transaction ordering dependency in this contract.

8. Time manipulation: There does not appear to be any timestamp dependency in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: As the contract does not validate the length of the addresses, it is vulnerable to short address attacks.

Note: This is an analysis based on the code provided. The actual vulnerabilities may vary based on how the contract is used and the overall context within which it operates.
