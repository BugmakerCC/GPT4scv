The smart contract provided has at least two vulnerabilities.

1. Wrong Constructor Name: The intended constructor function `DynamicPyramid()` does not match the contract name `Rubixi`. This means that the function can be called by anyone, not just at contract creation. This is a critical vulnerability as it allows any user to call this function and change the `creator` address. The new `creator` can then change the contractâ€™s rules, collect all fees, etc. This is an example of an Access Control vulnerability.

2. Unchecked Return Value: In many places where `.send()` is used, the return value is not checked. This can lead to failed transactions being silently ignored. For instance, in the `addPayout(uint _fee)` function, if the `.send()` fails, the balance is still deducted and the payoutOrder is still incremented. This can lead to Denial of Service for the rightful recipients of the payout.

Additionally, the contract may be vulnerable to Reentrancy attacks, as it calls external contracts (via the `.send()` function) after changing its state. However, as `.send()` only forwards 2300 gas (which is not enough to call another contract), this might not be exploitable.
