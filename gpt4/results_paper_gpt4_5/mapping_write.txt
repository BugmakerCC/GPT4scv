The given smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Access Control: The `owner` of the contract is not set in the constructor. This means that anyone can call the `withdraw` function and drain the contract of its Ether. A potential fix would be to set the `owner` in the constructor of the contract as follows:

```solidity
constructor() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
}
```

2. Arithmetic Issues: If the `set` function is called with a very large `key` value, it could cause an integer overflow in the line `map.length = key + 1;`. The new length could then become very small, leading to an array out of bounds error when `map[key] = value;` is executed. This can be mitigated by adding checks to ensure `key` is not too large.

3. Denial of Service: If the `set` function is called with a large `key`, it could cause the contract to reach the gas limit. This is because resizing an array in solidity is an operation that costs gas proportional to the size increase.

4. Unchecked Return Values: The `msg.sender.transfer` function in the `withdraw` function can fail silently, it's a good practice to check the return value of `transfer`.

5. Short Address Attack: This is not directly applicable to this contract, but if the contract interacts with other contracts or external addresses, there could be a potential for short address attacks.

Note: This contract doesn't show explicit issues related to Reentrancy, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation directly. But depending upon how it's used or integrated, those vulnerabilities could potentially arise.
