The given smart contract contains the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it calls an external contract (via the "send" function) before it has resolved its internal state. If a malicious contract is called, it can reenter the contract and drain the contract's Ether.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract is using send() function but not checking its return value. The send() function may fail and return false. The contract should handle this failure case.

3. Denial of Service: If one player does not play the game, the contract is stuck: the second player cannot play. This can be seen as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

4. Access Control: The contract has an owner, but the ownership is not used for anything. If the owner is supposed to have special privileges, they are not currently implemented.

5. Arithmetic Issues: There is no check if the number provided by the players is within certain limits. This can lead to integer overflow or underflow if a large number is provided.

6. Front-Running: Here, the second player can always win by looking at the first player's number and then choosing an appropriate number. This is essentially a front-running vulnerability. 

7. Time Manipulation: Although not visible in this particular contract, time manipulation could be a potential issue in future modifications of the contract. This contract does not depend on timestamps, but if it did, it would be vulnerable to miners manipulating the timestamp.

8. Bad Randomness: While this contract does not use random numbers, if it did, it would be vulnerable to attacks due to bad randomness. 

9. Short Address Attack: This contract does not appear to be vulnerable to a short address attack. However, it's important to keep this vulnerability in mind when developing future contracts.
