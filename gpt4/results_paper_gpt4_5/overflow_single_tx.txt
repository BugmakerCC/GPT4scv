The smart contract you provided seems to have an Arithmetic Issue vulnerability, specifically integer overflow and underflow. 

1. Integer Overflow: This can occur in the function 'overflowaddtostate' and 'overflowmultostate' when the 'input' value is so large that when added or multiplied with 'count', it exceeds the maximum limit that the uint256 type can store, causing the count to overflow and reset to a small number.

2. Integer Underflow: This can occur in the function 'underflowtostate' and 'underflowlocalonly'. If the 'input' value is greater than 'count', subtracting 'input' from 'count' would cause 'count' to underflow, resetting it to a very large number.

There are no checks in place to prevent these overflows and underflows from happening. This could be prevented by using SafeMath library in Solidity which provides functions for safe mathematical operations that throw an error when an overflow or underflow occurs.

Other vulnerabilities do not seem to be present in this contract. The contract doesn't handle any Ether, so reentrancy and denial of service are not applicable. There's no randomness involved, so bad randomness is not a concern. There's no dependence on external calls or time, so front-running and time manipulation are not issues. There are no visible access control mechanisms, making access control flaws irrelevant. The contract doesn't make any low level calls, so unchecked return values for low level calls are not relevant. And the contract doesn't interact with any external addresses, so a short address attack is not a concern.
