The contract provided has an arithmetic issue vulnerability, specifically an integer underflow. The `require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);` statement is meant to prevent the function from executing if the sender does not have enough tokens to transfer. However, since balances are stored as unsigned integers (uint), if the `_value` to be transferred is more than the sender's balance, the subtraction will underflow and wrap around to a very large number, which will be greater than zero and pass the `require` statement.

The secure way to handle this is by using SafeMath library for arithmetic operations which are available in OpenZeppelin libraries. The corrected version of the function would look like this:

```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(_value <= balances[msg.sender]);
    balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_value);
    return true;
}
```

Other vulnerabilities like Reentrancy, Access Control, Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls, Denial of Service, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, Short Address Attack don't seem to be present in this code as it does not have any recursive calls, external calls, uses randomness, time dependencies, or short address inputs. The access control seems to be correctly implemented as there are no administrative functions or privileged operations that need to be protected.
