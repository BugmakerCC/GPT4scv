The smart contract provided here does contain several vulnerabilities. Let's go through each of them:

1. Reentrancy: Vulnerable. The "WithdrawToHolder" and "WithdrawToken" functions are vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because they first send the ETH or tokens and then update the balance. An attacker can create a fallback function to call the withdraw function again before the balance is updated.

2. Access Control: Vulnerable. The 'onlyOwner' modifier contains no logic except a check of ownership. If the condition owner == msg.sender fails, it does nothing to stop the execution of the function. It should revert the transaction if the condition fails.

3. Arithmetic Issues: Not present in this contract.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: Vulnerable. The low-level functions 'call' and 'call.value' are used without checking the return value, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

5. Denial of Service: Not present in this contract.

6. Bad Randomness: Not present in this contract.

7. Front-Running: Not present in this contract.

8. Time manipulation: Not present in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: Not present in this contract.

It's also worth noting that the 'changeOwner' and 'confirmOwner' functions in the 'Ownable' contract have a potential security issue. If the 'changeOwner' function is called by the owner, the 'newOwner' variable can be set, but the 'owner' variable is not updated until the 'confirmOwner' function is called by the 'newOwner'. This can lead to a situation where the 'owner' thinks they have transferred ownership, but the 'newOwner' hasn't confirmed yet, and thus the 'owner' still has control over the contract.
