The provided smart contract has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: There's a potential reentrancy vulnerability in the `withdrawEther` and `withdrawTokens` functions. If the `transfer` function call in these functions is invoked by a malicious contract, it could potentially make a recursive call back into `withdrawEther` or `withdrawTokens` before the first invocation of the function has finished. This could lead to funds being drained from the contract.
   
2. Access Control: The `withdrawEther` and `withdrawTokens` functions can be called by any address, not just the owner. This is a major access control issue, as it allows anyone to withdraw tokens or Ether from the contract.
    
3. Unchecked Return Values: The `transfer` function calls in `withdrawEther` and `withdrawTokens` functions do not check the return value. This could lead to failed transfers going unnoticed.
   
4. Denial of Service: The `getTokens` function could potentially lead to a denial of service. If the `addr.call.value(0 wei)();` line is called with a contract that has a fallback function which consumes a lot of gas, it could potentially cause out of gas exceptions.

5. Bad Randomness: Not applicable in this contract.

6. Front-Running: Not applicable in this contract.

7. Time manipulation: Not applicable in this contract.

8. Short Address Attack: Not applicable in this contract.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, you should include access control mechanisms to limit who can call sensitive functions, check return values of external calls, use the `transfer` function instead of `call.value` to prevent reentrancy, and be careful about the amount of gas a function can consume.
