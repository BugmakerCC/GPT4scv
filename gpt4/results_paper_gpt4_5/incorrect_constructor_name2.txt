The contract has an Access Control vulnerability due to the incorrect constructor name. The contract intends to set the contract deployer as the owner in the `missing` function which is intended to be a constructor. However, since the function name does not match the contract name and it's not declared as a constructor, it does not act as a constructor. Therefore, anyone can call the `missing` function and become the owner of the contract. 

Here's the potential fix for this vulnerability:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Missing{
    address private owner;

    modifier onlyowner {
        require(msg.sender==owner);
        _;
    }
    
    constructor()
        public
    {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function () payable {}

    function withdraw()
        public
        onlyowner
    {
       owner.transfer(this.balance);
    }
}
```
In this fixed contract, the `missing` function has been replaced with the `constructor` keyword which means it will be executed only once during the contract deployment. This designates the contract deployer as the owner, as initially intended.

Please note that the code does not seem to have other vulnerabilities listed but it's always a good practice to thoroughly test smart contract code with different tools and techniques before deployment as some vulnerabilities might not be easily visible.
