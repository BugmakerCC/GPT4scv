This contract has a Reentrancy vulnerability.

In the `withdrawBalance` function, the state variable `userBalances[msg.sender]` is set to 0 after the call to `msg.sender.send(amountToWithdraw)`. This introduces a reentrancy bug, because external contract calls can execute unknown code and potentially call `withdrawBalance` again before the first call has finished. 

If this happens, `userBalances[msg.sender]` would still contain the original balance at the time of the second call, allowing the caller to withdraw more Ether than they should be able to. 

To fix this, the state variable should be set before the external call:

```solidity
function withdrawBalance() {  
    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
    
    require(msg.sender.send(amountToWithdraw));
}
```

However, the contract doesn't check the return value of the `send` function. If the `send` function fails, it returns `false`, but the contract doesn't handle this case, which could lead to loss of funds. 

A better way to transfer Ether is to use the `transfer` function, which throws on failure:

```solidity
function withdrawBalance() {  
    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
    
    msg.sender.transfer(amountToWithdraw);
}
```

Additionally, there is no access control implemented in `withdrawBalance` function. Any address can call it and attempt to withdraw Ether. Although it will not be successful if the address has no balance, it is still a good practice to implement a check to ensure only the address with balance can call this function.
