This smart contract has several potential vulnerabilities as follows:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it doesn't call external contracts in a way that state changes could be affected by external input.

2. Access Control: The contract properly uses the `onlyOwner` and `onlyBot` modifiers to restrict access to specific functions to the contract owner and bot. However, it doesn't check if owner, bot or secretSigner addresses are valid (non-zero) in the constructor.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not use SafeMath library for arithmetic operations which could potentially lead to integer overflow and underflow errors.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses `.call.value()()`, `.transfer()` and `.send()` methods to transfer funds but does not check for their return values which could lead to unchecked send vulnerabilities.

5. Denial of Service: The contract seems to be vulnerable to a DoS attack in the `refund` function. If one player blocks the refund operation, it might block others as well.

6. Bad Randomness: The `play` function generates a "random" number using blockhash and a passed value, which can be manipulated by the miner.

7. Front-Running: Since transactions on Ethereum are public, malicious users can see a transaction in the pool and then try to front-run it.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses `block.number` for its `refund` function, which could potentially be manipulated by miners.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract does not seem to be vulnerable to short address attacks as it does not deal with token transfers from user addresses.

Please note that this is a preliminary analysis and further in-depth testing and analysis may reveal additional vulnerabilities.
