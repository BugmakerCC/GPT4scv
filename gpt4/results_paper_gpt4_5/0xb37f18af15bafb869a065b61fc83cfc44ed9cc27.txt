The smart contract has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdraw(uint _value)` and `sendMoney(address _target, uint _value)` functions are vulnerable to reentrancy attacks since they call external contracts (`msg.sender` or `_target`) and transfer value before any internal state is updated.

2. Access Control: The contract has a basic access control implemented with the `onlyOwner` modifier. However, there is no functionality that allows for the change of the `owner` in case the owner's private key is lost or compromised.

3. Arithmetic Issues: This contract does not seem to have any arithmetic operations, therefore it is not vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `sendMoney(address _target, uint _value)` function uses a low-level call to transfer funds, but it does not check the return value.

5. Denial of Service: The `withdrawAll()` function could potentially lead to DoS if it fails to send funds, as it does not handle exceptions.

6. Bad Randomness: This contract does not use any randomness, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: As the contract does not use any price or value-based conditions, it is not vulnerable to front-running.

8. Time manipulation: This contract does not use any time or block parameters, so it's not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract does not take any user input for addresses, it only uses `msg.sender` and `_target` (which is provided by the owner). Therefore, it does not seem to be vulnerable to short address attacks.

It's recommended to revise the contract to mitigate the detected vulnerabilities, especially reentrancy and unchecked return values for low level calls.
