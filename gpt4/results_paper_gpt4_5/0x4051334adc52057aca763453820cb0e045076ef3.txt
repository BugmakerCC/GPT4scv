The smart contract provided has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `transfer` function is potentially vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v);` line is calling an external contract. If this external contract calls back into the `transfer` function before the first invocation of the function has completed, it might cause unexpected behavior. 

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: Low-level calls like `.call()` do not automatically throw an exception when the call fails, unlike high-level calls. The return value of `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v);` is not checked, meaning that the call could fail silently. You should always check the return value of `call` and handle potential failures appropriately.

3. Denial of Service (DoS): If one of the addresses in `_tos` causes the `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v);` to throw an exception or run out of gas, all subsequent transfers will be halted due to the error. This is a kind of Denial of Service (DoS) attack known as a "griefing" attack.

4. Access Control: The `transfer` function is public and does not have any access control mechanisms, meaning that anyone can call this function and potentially transfer tokens from any address to any other address, as long as they know the method ID for the `transferFrom` function. This is a serious security risk.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, you should:

- Implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can call the `transfer` function.
- Use the `transferFrom` function from the ERC20 standard instead of a low-level call.
- Check the return value of `call` and handle potential failures.
- Implement a pull payment system to avoid potential DoS attacks.
