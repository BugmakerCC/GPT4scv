The smart contract contains several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `GetPie()` can potentially lead to a reentrancy attack, because it first sends funds to the owner, then to the message sender. An attacker could potentially make a recursive call to the `GetPie()` function in the fallback function of its contract, draining the contract of its funds.

2. Access Control: The `withdraw()` and `Command()` functions require the sender to be the owner of the contract. However, the owner can be changed by anyone if they send a transaction where `msg.sender` is `0x1Fb3acdBa788CA50Ce165E5A4151f05187C67cd6`. This allows an attacker to take over the contract.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: In the `Command()` function, the contract makes a low-level call to an arbitrary address supplied by the user. The return value of this call is not checked, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

4. Denial of Service: If an attacker becomes the owner, they can easily drain the contract of its funds, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.

5. Bad Randomness, Front-running, Time manipulation, Short Address Attack: These vulnerabilities don't apply to this contract, as there is no use of randomness, timestamps, or address lengths.

6. Arithmetic Issues: The contract doesn't do any arithmetic operations, so it's not vulnerable to arithmetic issues.

Recommendation: It's advised to avoid state changes after external calls, use the `transfer` function instead of `call.value`, check the return values of external calls, and beware of reentrancy attacks.
