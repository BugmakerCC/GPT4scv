This smart contract has an Arithmetic Issues vulnerability, specifically it has an integer overflow and underflow issue. 

In the function `transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)`, the contract checks if the sender has enough balance, deducts the `_value` from the sender's balance, and then adds the `_value` to the recipient's balance. The problem here is that there are no checks to prevent overflow or underflow. 

For instance, if the recipient's balance is very large, adding more value could cause it to overflow and wrap around to a very small number. Similarly, if the sender's balance is very small, subtracting value could cause it to underflow and wrap around to a very large number. 

These scenarios could lead to serious issues like theft of tokens or loss of funds. 

To fix this issue, the contract should use SafeMath library for arithmetic operations which includes checks for overflow and underflow.
