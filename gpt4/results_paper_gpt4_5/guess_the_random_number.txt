Here are the vulnerabilities in the given smart contract:

1. Bad Randomness: The random number is being generated by keccak256 hash of the previous blockhash and current timestamp. This can be predicted by miners as they have access to this information. Hence, this contract is vulnerable to the bad randomness attack.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms. Any address can call the `guess` function and possibly win the game. 

3. Unchecked Return Values for Low Level Calls: The contract does not check the return value of `msg.sender.transfer`. If this function call fails for some reason, the contract will not be aware of it.

4. Denial of Service: If the contract's balance is less than 2 ethers, then `msg.sender.transfer(2 ether);` will throw an exception, making the `guess` function unusable.

5. Arithmetic issues: The contract does not handle possible overflows or underflows when making calculations. 

6. Reentrancy: Although not directly present in this contract, if the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract that includes a fallback function that calls back into `guess` function, it could cause a reentrancy attack. 

7. Front-Running: Since the answer is deterministic and can be calculated by anyone who sees the transaction in the mempool, a malicious actor could front-run the transaction by placing a higher gas price.

8. Time Manipulation: The answer is dependent on `now` which is actually `block.timestamp` and can be manipulated by miners to a certain extent, making the contract vulnerable to timestamp manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: This is not applicable in this contract as the contract does not take address as an input from the user.
