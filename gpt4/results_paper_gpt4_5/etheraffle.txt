1. Reentrancy: This contract does not seem to have a reentrancy vulnerability. There is no nested external contract call with a state change after the call.

2. Access Control: The contract has a potential access control vulnerability. The functions `endRaffle()`, `togglePause()`, and `kill()` can only be called by the owner of the contract (the address that deployed it). If the ownerâ€™s private key gets compromised, the attacker can pause the contract and prevent users from buying tickets or they can kill the contract and make it completely unusable.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There doesn't seem to be any obvious arithmetic issues. All calculations appear to be handled correctly.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses `.transfer()` function for sending ether which throws an exception on failure, so there is no unchecked return values vulnerability.

5. Denial of Service: The `endRaffle()` function could potentially be used to carry out a Denial of Service attack by the owner of the contract by constantly ending the raffle, preventing users from buying tickets.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract is vulnerable to bad randomness in the `chooseWinner()` function. It uses the `block.coinbase`, `msg.sender`, and `block.difficulty` as seed for generating random numbers which can be manipulated by miners.

7. Front-Running: The contract is vulnerable to front-running. Since Ethereum transactions are public on the blockchain, a miner or a participant can see the transaction of a new ticket purchase and then place their own transaction with a higher gas price to buy a ticket, potentially influencing the outcome of the raffle.

8. Time manipulation: The contract is vulnerable to time manipulation as it relies on `block.number` for keeping track of the raffle. Miners can manipulate this value.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract doesn't appear to be vulnerable to a short address attack as it does not take address inputs from external calls.
