The smart contract has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdraw` function is prone to reentrancy attacks. The state of the contract (in this case, `Deposits[msg.sender]`) is not updated before the `transfer` function call, allowing a malicious contract to reenter the function and withdraw more than its balance.

2. Access Control: The `transferOwner` function in the `Proxy` contract can be exploited. If the contract owner's address is compromised, the attacker can transfer the ownership to their own address.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no safeguards against integer underflow or overflow in this contract. This is particularly relevant in the `withdraw` function where the `Deposits[msg.sender]` could underflow if `amount` is greater than `Deposits[msg.sender]`.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The low-level `call` method in the `proxy` function does not check the return value. If the call fails, the contract will not be notified and will continue execution.

5. Denial of Service: An attacker could potentially cause the contract to throw an unexpected exception or use up all the gas, especially on the `proxy` function where a call is made to an arbitrary address with arbitrary data.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable in this contract.

7. Front-Running: Front-running is possible in the `deposit` function where an attacker could see a transaction in the mempool and then front-run it to get benefits.

8. Time manipulation: Not applicable in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable in this contract as the length of the address isn't taken from an external source.

It's recommended to use well-audited libraries or built-in language features for handling the above vulnerabilities, such as `SafeMath` for arithmetic operations or `OpenZeppelin` for ownership.
