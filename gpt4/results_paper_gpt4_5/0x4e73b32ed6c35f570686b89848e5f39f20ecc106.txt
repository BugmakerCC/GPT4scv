This smart contract seems to contain several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `Collect(uint _am)` contains a reentrancy vulnerability due to the use of `call.value`. This function sends Ether to an address before the state (balance) is updated, which could allow a malicious contract to continuously call back into this function and drain the contract of Ether.

2. Access control: The functions `SetMinSum(uint _val)` and `SetLogFile(address _log)` both require that the contract has not been initialized. However, there doesn't seem to be any restriction on who can call these functions. This means anyone can call these functions before the contract is initialized. 

3. Arithmetic issues: There's no safe math library used in this contract. It's possible that an overflow or underflow could occur when the balances are being updated in the `Deposit()` and `Collect(uint _am)` functions.

4. Unchecked return values for low-level calls: There is no check on the return value of the `call.value` function in the `Collect(uint _am)` function. This could lead to silent failures.

5. Denial of service: If a malicious actor sets the `LogFile` to a contract that reverts in the `AddMessage` function, it could potentially freeze the `Deposit()` and `Collect(uint _am)` functions in the `PRIVATE_ETH_CELL` contract.

6. Bad randomness: No randomness is used in this contract, so this issue doesn't occur here.

7. Front-running: No transaction ordering dependence is visible in this contract, so this issue doesn't occur here.

8. Time manipulation: The `LogFile` contract uses `now` to set the timestamp. This can be manipulated by miners to some degree, although it doesn't seem to have a significant impact on the contract's functionality.

9. Short address attack: This contract doesn't seem to be at risk of a short address attack as it doesn't take address input from users to perform transfers or similar operations.

The contract should be rewritten to address these vulnerabilities.
