The provided smart contract code has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `CashOut` is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it calls an external contract (in this case `msg.sender`) before updating the state (`balances[msg.sender] -= _am;`). An attacker could potentially recursively call the `CashOut` function before the state is updated and drain the contract's funds.

2. Arithmetic Issues: While there don't seem to be any direct arithmetic issues, the lack of SafeMath library for arithmetic operations could potentially lead to integer overflow and underflow.

3. Unchecked Return Value: The contract doesn't check the return value of `TransferLog.AddMessage` function call, which can potentially fail silently.

4. Denial of Service: The contract doesn't prevent a potential DoS attack if `msg.sender` becomes a contract that always throws in its fallback function.

5. Bad Randomness: This contract doesn't seem to use randomness.

6. Front-Running: The contract doesn't appear to prevent front-running attacks.

7. Time manipulation: There is a potential for time manipulation as the contract uses the `now` keyword (alias for `block.timestamp`), which can be manipulated by miners to some extent.

8. Short Address Attack: The contract doesn't check for the length of the address, which could potentially lead to a short address attack.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the contract should use a pull payment system instead of direct transfers, use the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, check the return values of external function calls, and introduce measures to prevent potential DoS and front-running attacks.
