The given smart contract seems to have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1. Arithmetic Issues - The `sendCoin` function directly subtracts the `amount` from the sender's balance and adds it to the recipient's balance. If the sender has enough balance to cover the `amount`, the subtraction operation could underflow if the `amount` is greater than the sender's balance. Similarly, the addition operation could overflow if the `amount` added to the recipient's balance exceeds the maximum possible uint256 value. 

2. Access Control - The `MyToken` constructor sets the balance of the contract creator to 10000 tokens, but there are no checks or restrictions on who can call the `sendCoin` function. This means that anyone (even someone who has not been allocated any tokens) can call the function and potentially manipulate the balances mapping if there is an arithmetic overflow/underflow.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls - The `sendCoin` function returns a boolean value to indicate whether the transfer was successful or not. But this return value is never checked anywhere in the contract. 

4. Bad Randomness - Although not explicitly using random numbers, the contract is dependent on the `msg.sender` value which can be influenced by the sender of the transaction.

5. Front-Running - Since the `sendCoin` function is public and not shielded against re-entrancy, there is a potential for a front-running attack where a malicious user can see a pending transaction and try to manipulate it.

6. Time manipulation & Short Address Attack - Although these vulnerabilities are not directly present in the contract, they are potential risks for any Ethereum contract. For example, the block timestamp (`now` in Solidity) can be manipulated by miners to a certain degree, and users can potentially send transactions with a short address to trick the contract into transferring more coins than intended.

The smart contract does not seem to have the following vulnerabilities:
- Reentrancy, Denial of Service: The contract does not make any external calls, so there is no risk of reentrancy or denial of service attacks.
- Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on any timestamp or block information, so there is no risk of time manipulation issues.
- Short Address Attack: The contract does not rely on the length of the address, so there is no risk of short address attacks.
