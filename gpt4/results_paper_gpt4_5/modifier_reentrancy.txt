This contract primarily suffers from a Reentrancy vulnerability. 

1. Reentrancy: The contract `attack` has re-entrancy vulnerability. The function `supportsToken()` in `attack` contract is a fallback function which is called when the `airDrop()` function in `ModifierEntrancy` contract is called. Here, `ModifierEntrancy(msg.sender).airDrop();` is a recursive call where `airDrop()` calls `supportsToken()`, which again calls `airDrop()`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and drain of Ether from the contract.

The other vulnerabilities mentioned don't appear present:

2. Access Control: There's no administrative function in the contract that could have access control issues.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic calculations that might lead to an overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: There are no low level calls (like `call`, `send` or `delegatecall`) in the contract.

5. Denial of Service: No loops over external contract addresses, so there's no potential for someone to keep the contract busy for a long time.

6. Bad Randomness: No use of block variables like `block.timestamp`, `block.number`, `block.difficulty` which can be manipulated by miners.

7. Front-Running: There's no transaction ordering or time dependency that would allow for front-running.

8. Time manipulation: No use of block variables like `block.timestamp` or `block.number` which can be manipulated by miners.

9. Short Address Attack: There's no direct `transfer` or `send` function which could have short address attack vulnerability. 

Please note that it's always recommended to have a comprehensive audit by a security expert before deploying a smart contract.
