The contract provided has the following vulnerabilities:

1. **Constructor Misnaming (Access Control)** - In Solidity 0.4.22 and later, constructors should be defined using the `constructor` keyword. In this contract the constructor is named `Constructor` which will not be recognized as a constructor in Solidity 0.4.22 and later. Anyone can call this function and become the owner of the contract. This is a severe security risk.

2. **Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls** - In the `withdraw` function, the return value of the `transfer` function is not checked. If the `transfer` function call fails for any reason (like a throw), the contract will not be aware and will continue execution.

3. **Reentrancy** - Although the contract has a withdrawal pattern, it is still susceptible to a reentrancy attack because it calls an external contract (via `transfer`) after changing its own state (by decrementing `this.balance`). If the `owner` address is a malicious contract, it could call `withdraw` again before the first call is finished.

4. **Denial of Service (DoS)** - If the `owner` address is a contract with a fallback function that consumes a lot of gas, the `transfer` function in `withdraw` could run out of gas, preventing the owner from ever withdrawing the funds.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the contract should:

- Rename the `Constructor` function to `constructor`.
- Check the return value of `transfer`.
- Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy.
- Use a pull payment system instead of `transfer` to avoid DoS attacks.
