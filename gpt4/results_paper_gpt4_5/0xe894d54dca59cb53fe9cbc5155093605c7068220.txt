The smart contract `airDrop` contains the following vulnerabilities:

1. **Reentrancy**: The contract uses low-level `call()` function, which can be a potential source of reentrancy attack if the called contract has a fallback function that calls back the `transfer` function.

2. **Unchecked Return Values for Low Level Calls**: The return value of the `call()` function is not checked, which means that if the call fails, the contract will not be aware of it.

3. **Access Control**: There is no access control mechanism present. Anybody can call the `transfer` function, which can lead to unauthorized access.

4. **Arithmetic Issues**: There is no safe math library used for arithmetic calculations. This could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow.

5. **Denial of Service**: If the `transferFrom` function of the token contract being called fails or gets stuck (for example, due to an infinite loop), then subsequent addresses in the `_tos` array will not receive tokens.

The contract does not appear to have vulnerabilities related to Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation or Short Address Attack. However, without knowing the full context and usage of the contract, it's hard to be sure.
