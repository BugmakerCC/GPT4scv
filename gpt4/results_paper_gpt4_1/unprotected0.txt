The smart contract has an Access Control vulnerability. The function `changeOwner(address _newOwner)` should only be executable by the current owner of the contract. However, it's currently public and can be executed by any address. 

Here's how this vulnerability can be exploited: An attacker can call the `changeOwner` function and pass their address as the `_newOwner` parameter. This would transfer ownership of the contract to the attacker. 

The commented out `changeOwner_fixed` function seems to have the correct implementation with the `onlyowner` modifier. This modifier ensures that the function can only be called by the current owner of the contract. 

This vulnerability can be fixed by uncommenting the `changeOwner_fixed` function and commenting out or removing the `changeOwner` function. 

The smart contract does not seem to have the other vulnerabilities listed. 

Please note that this analysis assumes that the `onlyowner` modifier is implemented correctly. If the `onlyowner` modifier is flawed, there could be additional vulnerabilities.
