The smart contract you provided exhibits the "Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls" vulnerability. 

In Solidity, low level calls such as '.call()' return a boolean indicating if the operation was successful or not. If this return value is not checked, it can lead to unexpected behavior as the contract may continue executing even after a function call has failed. 

In the provided contract, the 'callnotchecked' function does not check the return value of 'callee.call()', which means it may not catch if the call fails. This can lead to the contract continuing execution even when not intended, leading to potential security consequences. 

The 'callchecked' function correctly uses 'require()' to check the return value of 'callee.call()'. If the call fails, 'require()' will revert all changes and stop execution of the contract.

The other vulnerabilities you listed are not apparent in this given smart contract.
