The given smart contract is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. This is due to the fact that the contract calls an external contract (via recipient.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("")) before it has finished executing all its functions. This could allow an attacker to reenter the contract before state changes have been made (i.e., before claimedBonus[recipient] = true;).

In the getFirstWithdrawalBonus function, the contract checks if the bonus has been claimed before increasing the reward and initiating a withdrawal. However, because the state variable claimedBonus[recipient] is not set to true until after the external call, an attacker could potentially reenter the contract and claim the bonus multiple times.

To mitigate this risk, the contract should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern, which suggests that interactions with other contracts should be the very last thing in any function. The contract should first perform any checks (require statements), then make any necessary changes to its own state, and only then interact with other contracts.

Here is the fixed version of the contract that follows this pattern:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract Reentrancy_bonus{

    mapping (address => uint) private userBalances;
    mapping (address => bool) private claimedBonus;
    mapping (address => uint) private rewardsForA;

    function withdrawReward(address recipient) public {
        uint amountToWithdraw = rewardsForA[recipient];
        rewardsForA[recipient] = 0;
        (bool success, ) = recipient.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("");
        require(success);
    }

    function getFirstWithdrawalBonus(address recipient) public {
        require(!claimedBonus[recipient]); // Each recipient should only be able to claim the bonus once

        claimedBonus[recipient] = true;
        rewardsForA[recipient] += 100;
        
        withdrawReward(recipient); // At this point, the caller will be able to execute getFirstWithdrawalBonus again.
    }
}
```

In this version, claimedBonus[recipient] is set to true before the external call, preventing reentrancy.
