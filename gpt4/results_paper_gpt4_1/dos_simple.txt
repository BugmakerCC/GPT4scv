The smart contract seems to have a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability related to the gas limit.

In the function "ifillArray", the contract is pushing the address of the message sender to an array multiple times in a loop. This operation consumes a certain amount of gas. If the length of the listAddresses array is less than 1500, it allows the loop to push the sender's address 350 times. This could be repeated multiple times, increasing the size of the array indefinitely.

If the array becomes very large, the operation to iterate over it or clear it (as done in the else condition) might exceed the block gas limit, causing the transaction to fail. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack, where a malicious actor intentionally fills the array to its maximum size, thus preventing anyone else from interacting with the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should limit the size of the array to a manageable size that doesn't exceed the block gas limit. Consider implementing a mechanism to prevent an attacker from filling up the array. For example, limit the number of addresses that can be added, or require a certain fee to add an address, which may deter an attacker from adding a large number of addresses.

There doesn't seem to be any other of the stated vulnerabilities in this contract. It doesn't have functionality that could lead to Reentrancy, Access Control, Arithmetic Issues, Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, or Short Address Attack vulnerabilities. However, it's always good to remain cautious and carry out comprehensive testing before deploying a smart contract.
