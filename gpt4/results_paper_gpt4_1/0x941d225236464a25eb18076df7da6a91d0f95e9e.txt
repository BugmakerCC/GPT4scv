The provided smart contract has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it makes an external call to `msg.sender` before it reduces the balance of the `msg.sender`. An attacker, in their fallback function, can re-enter the `CashOut` function before `balances[msg.sender] -= _am;` is executed, allowing them to withdraw more Ether than they should.

2. Arithmetic Issues: The `Deposit` function uses `+=` to increase the balance of `msg.sender`, which could potentially lead to an integer overflow if `msg.value` is large enough. An integer overflow would wrap the balance around to a very small number, effectively stealing all the Ether in the contract.

3. Unchecked Return Values: The return value of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `CashOut` function is not checked. Although the balance is only updated if the call is successful, it's generally a good practice to handle potential errors explicitly.

4. Access Control: It seems anyone can call the `AddMessage` function of the `Log` contract. If this contract is intended to be used only by the `ETH_FUND` contract, then this is a security issue.

5. Denial of Service: If the `msg.sender` in the `CashOut` function is a contract that throws an exception in its fallback function, then the `CashOut` function will be permanently stuck because `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` will always fail.

6. Bad Randomness and Front-Running: These vulnerabilities are not present in this contract.

7. Time Manipulation: The contract uses `block.number` for time measurement which can be manipulated by miners to a certain degree. But in this case, it doesn't cause a notable vulnerability.

8. Short Address Attack: This contract is not vulnerable to short address attacks. 

Please note that this analysis doesn't mean the contract is completely secure. Other potential security issues might still exist.
