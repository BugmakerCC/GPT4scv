Looking at the code, here are some potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `GetFreebie` and `withdraw` functions are vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. After each `if` condition is met, the contract's balance is sent to `msg.sender` or `Owner`. An attacker can create a contract that invokes `GetFreebie` or `withdraw`, and during the transfer, it can again call `GetFreebie` or `withdraw`, draining the contract's balance. 

2. Access Control: The `Command` function allows the owner to call any function on any contract with arbitrary data. This can be a security risk if the owner's address is compromised. 

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses `call.value()` which is a low-level call and does not handle its return value. If this call fails, the contract will not be aware of it.

4. Denial of Service: In `GetFreebie` function, if msg.value is more than 1 ether, the function tries to send all contract's balance to the `msg.sender`. If this transfer fails (for example, because the fallback function of the recipient requires more gas than available), the function will revert and no one will be able to call this function again.

5. Gas Limit Reached: The `Command` function can potentially exceed the gas limit if it's used to execute complex functions or operations.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable in this contract as no randomness is involved.

7. Front-Running: Not directly applicable as there's no dependent transactions in this contract but the contract could be susceptible to transaction ordering manipulation by miners.

8. Time Manipulation: Not applicable in this contract as no timestamp variables are used.

9. Short Address Attack: Not directly applicable as the contract doesn't handle `msg.data` directly but the `Command` function could be potentially misused to call functions with shortened addresses.

In conclusion, the contract has several vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to ensure security.
