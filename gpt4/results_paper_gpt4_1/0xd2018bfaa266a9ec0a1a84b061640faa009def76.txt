This smart contract appears to have a few potential vulnerabilities from the given list:

1. Reentrancy: The functions `Get()` and `withdraw()` both include a `transfer()` method that sends the entire contract balance (`this.balance`). A malicious contract could trigger these functions multiple times before the state of the contract is updated, effectively draining the contract's balance. This is a classic example of a reentrancy attack.

2. Access Control: There is no proper access control mechanism in place. Any address can call the `Get()` function and potentially drain the contract if it sends more than 1 ether. The `withdraw()` and `Command()` functions also rely on the `Owner` address, but this can be changed by any address that matches `0x1Fb3acdBa788CA50Ce165E5A4151f05187C67cd6`.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `Command()` function uses a low level `.call()` method. The return value of this call is not checked which could lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

4. Denial of Service: The `Get()` function transfers the entire balance of the contract to the `Owner` address and then to the `msg.sender` address. If the first transfer fails, the second transfer will never occur, essentially locking the funds in the contract.

5. Front-Running: The `Get()` function could potentially be exploited by a frontrunning attack. A malicious actor could watch the transaction pool for any transaction calling this function and then send a transaction with a higher gas price, effectively getting in front of the original transaction.

It's important to note that this analysis is based on the provided list of vulnerabilities. There could be other security issues not covered by this list.
