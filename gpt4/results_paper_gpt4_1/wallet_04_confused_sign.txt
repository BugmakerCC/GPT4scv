Here are the vulnerabilities detected in the smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: This smart contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy because there is no callback before the state is updated.

2. Access Control: The function "withdraw()" is vulnerable because there is no access control to check if the caller has enough balance before withdrawing. This can lead to unauthorized access and potential loss of funds.

3. Arithmetic Issues: No apparent issues in this contract.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract has an unchecked send when transferring funds with the 'transfer' function. If the call fails for any reason, the contract will not be aware of it.

5. Denial of Service: The contract could be susceptible to a DoS attack if an attacker keeps calling the "withdraw()" function repeatedly, causing the contract to run out of gas.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable.

8. Time manipulation: Not applicable.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable.

To fix the vulnerability in the "withdraw()" function, the contract should ensure that the caller has enough balance to withdraw the amount requested. The corrected condition should be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);`.

For the unchecked send, it should handle the potential failure of the 'transfer' function. A common practice is to use the 'revert()' function to undo all changes if the 'transfer' function fails.
