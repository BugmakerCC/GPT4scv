The contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `withdraw()` is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack as it allows for external calls (via the `transfer()` function) before the state of the contract is updated. An attacker could recursively call the `withdraw()` function and drain the contract of its Ether.

2. Access Control: The modifier `onlyOwner` in the `Proxy` contract and the `Owner` variable in the `VaultProxy` contract could potentially conflict with each other. If the owner in `Proxy` is different from the owner in `VaultProxy`, someone could potentially call functions restricted to the owner in `VaultProxy`.

3. Unchecked Return Values: The low-level `call` function in the `proxy` function of the `Proxy` contract does not check the return value. If the call fails, the contract will not be aware. 

4. Denial of Service: If a contract that throws exceptions is called with the `proxy` function, it could potentially cause the `Proxy` contract to stop functioning.

5. Bad Randomness: Not applicable. The contract does not use any randomness.

6. Front-Running: The `deposit` function is vulnerable to front-running. Another user could see a transaction calling this function in the mempool and can send a transaction with a higher gas price to get it mined first.

7. Time Manipulation: Not applicable. The contract does not rely on block timestamp or block number.

8. Short Address Attack: Not applicable. The contract does not take any addresses as input for function calls that move Ether or tokens.

One way to mitigate these vulnerabilities would be to use a `mutex` or `reentrancy guard` to prevent reentrancy attacks, check the return value of all external calls, and to ensure there are no conflicts in the access control mechanisms. Also, using the `transfer` or `send` functions instead of `call.value()` can prevent re-entrancy attacks. And finally, using commit-reveal schemes or similar mechanisms can help prevent front-running.
