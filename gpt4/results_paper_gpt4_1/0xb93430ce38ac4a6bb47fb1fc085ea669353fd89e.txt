The smart contract you provided has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `CashOut(uint _am)` is vulnerable to reentrancy attack because it uses a call value()() function before adjusting the balance of the message sender. An attacker can exploit this by initiating a fallback function in their smart contract to call `CashOut(uint _am)` again before the previous call finishes executing.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses low level call `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `CashOut(uint _am)` function and does not check its return value. This can cause the contract to fail silently and continue execution even when the call fails.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not check for potential underflows when subtracting from the balance of an address in `balances[msg.sender] -= _am;`. If `_am` is greater than `balances[msg.sender]`, this will cause an underflow and the balance of the address will be set to a very large number.

4. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism in place. Any address can call the `CashOut(uint _am)` function and withdraw Ether from the contract if the balance of the address is greater than or equal to `_am`.

The contract does not appear to have the following vulnerabilities:

1. Denial of Service
2. Bad Randomness
3. Front-Running
4. Time manipulation
5. Short Address Attack

Also, please note that this analysis does not guarantee that the contract is safe from all vulnerabilities. Further security audits might be necessary to ensure the contract's safety.
