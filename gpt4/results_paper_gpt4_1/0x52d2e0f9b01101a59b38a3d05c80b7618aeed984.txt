This contract has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdrawEther` function is exposed to a reentrancy attack. If the `owner` address is a contract, it could potentially call `withdrawEther` again before the first call is finished, draining the contract of its ether.

2. Access Control: The contract's functions `withdrawTokens`, `withdrawEther`, and `getTokens` aren't restricted to a specific address or set of addresses. Anyone can call these functions, potentially leading to unauthorized withdrawals of tokens or ether.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: `addr.call.value(0 wei)()` in `getTokens` function is a low-level call without a check on its return value. If this call fails, the contract won't be able to catch the error.

4. Arithmetic Issues: Although not directly visible, the contract could potentially be exposed to arithmetic issues if it interacts with other contracts that don't handle arithmetic operations correctly.

5. Denial of Service: If the `Token` contract's `transfer` function isn't implemented correctly, it could potentially throw an error and halt execution of the `withdrawTokens` function, effectively locking up any tokens held by the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: Not explicitly present in this contract.

7. Front-Running: Not explicitly present in this contract.

8. Time manipulation: Not explicitly present in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract doesn't validate the length of the address inputs, so it could potentially be vulnerable to a short address attack. 

Remember, it's crucial to always audit your smart contracts thoroughly, preferably with automated tools and manual code review, to ensure they're secure against all known vulnerabilities.
