The following vulnerabilities exist in the given solidity code:

1. Re-Entrancy Vulnerability: The `redeem()` function is vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks because the state of the contract is not updated before sending funds with `msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);`. An attacker could continuously call the `redeem()` function before the state of the contract is updated, draining the contract of its Ether.

2. Access Control Vulnerability: The `withdraw()` function allows any user to change the owner of the contract if they are the address `0x7a617c2B05d2A74Ff9bABC9d81E5225C1e01004b`. This could allow an attacker to gain control of the contract.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `Command()` function uses a low-level call, `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);`, without checking its return value. This could potentially allow the execution of arbitrary code or cause the contract to fail silently. 

4. Denial of Service: An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service attack by repeatedly calling the `redeem()` function.

5. Arithmetic Issues: While there are no obvious arithmetic issues in this contract, it's still important to be aware of potential integer overflow and underflow issues when dealing with mathematical operations in Solidity.

6. Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, and Short Address Attack vulnerabilities are not present in this contract. 

It's also worth noting that the contract does not have a constructor, so it is possible that an attacker could deploy a copy of it and manipulate its state.
