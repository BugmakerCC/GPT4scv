The smart contract may have the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `withdraw()` and `sendMoney()` can be potentially exploited by a reentrancy attack. `msg.sender.transfer(_value)` and `_target.call.value(_value)(_data)` are transferring ether to an external address. If the external address is a malicious contract, it could call back into `withdraw()` or `sendMoney()` before the first call is finished, potentially draining the contract's funds.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The function `sendMoney()` uses a low level `.call()` function. This function returns a boolean value indicating success or failure but it is not checked in this contract. If the call fails for any reason, this contract won't be aware of it.

3. Denial of Service: If the owner of the contract becomes a contract which can throw on fallback, the `withdrawAll()` function could be locked forever, because it tries to send all the funds to owner.

4. Access Control: The contract seems to successfully implement an access control mechanism through the `onlyOwner` modifier for sensitive functions such as `withdrawAll()`, `withdraw()`, `sendMoney()`. 

5. Arithmetic Issues, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, Short Address Attack: These vulnerabilities do not seem to be present in the contract. 

Please note that this analysis is not exhaustive and only based on the provided smart contract code. It is recommended to perform a comprehensive security audit before deploying the contract on the mainnet.
