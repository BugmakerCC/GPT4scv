1. Reentrancy: The contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks. In the `multiplicate` function, external contract is called before the state (balance) is updated. An attacker could create a contract that calls back into `multiplicate` before `adr.transfer` has finished. 

2. Access Control: The contract seems to have implemented access controls correctly as it uses `require(msg.sender == Owner)` for the `withdraw` and `Command` functions that should be restricted to the contract owner. 

3. Arithmetic Issues: There doesn't seem to be an arithmetic issue here as no mathematical operations are performed that could potentially overflow/underflow. 

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses `adr.call.value` in the `Command` function without checking the return value. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails. 

5. Denial of Service: The contract seems to be vulnerable to DoS in the `multiplicate` function. An attacker could repeatedly call this function with enough ether to keep the contract's balance low, preventing others from using it.

6. Bad Randomness: There doesn't appear to be any reliance on randomness in this contract.

7. Front-Running: There doesn't appear to be any transaction ordering dependency which could make the contract vulnerable to Front-Running.

8. Time manipulation: This contract does not rely on timestamps so it's not vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to short address attacks as it does not manipulate input data based on length. 

Please note that this analysis assumes that the contract interactions are taking place in a secure environment and does not account for any off-chain or client vulnerabilities.
