After analyzing the smart contract, here are the potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This contract does not seem to have a reentrancy issue as there are no external contract calls inside a function where the state is altered.

2. Access Control: This contract lacks any access control mechanisms. Anyone can call `sendCoin` and transfer tokens from any account to any other account. This is a severe vulnerability.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not check for integer overflow or underflow which can lead to unexpected results.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: This contract does not make low-level calls, so this vulnerability does not apply.

5. Denial of Service: There don't seem to be any mechanisms that could be used for a denial of service attack in this contract.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not depend on randomness, so this vulnerability does not apply.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not seem to have any functions that could be abused through front-running.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not depend on time, so this vulnerability does not apply.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract is susceptible to short address attacks as it does not validate the length of the address in the `sendCoin` function. If a user inputs an address that is shorter than expected, the Solidity compiler will not throw an error but will instead pad the address with zeros on the right. This could lead to tokens being sent to an unintended address. 

In conclusion, the main vulnerabilities in this contract are Access Control, Arithmetic Issues and Short Address Attack. These should be addressed to ensure the contract is secure.
