The given smart contract has several vulnerabilities related to the listed common vulnerabilities.

1. Reentrancy: The `Collect` function is vulnerable to a Reentrancy attack. It uses a `call.value()` which allows the called contract to execute code. If the called contract is malicious, it can call back the `Collect` function before `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` is executed, leading to multiple withdrawals. This is a critical vulnerability and should be fixed immediately.

2. Access Control: The `SetMinSum` and `SetLogFile` functions can be called by anyone before initialization. There are no restrictions on who can set these parameters, leading to potential misuse. These functions should have access control checks to ensure that only the contract owner or authorized addresses can call them.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract doesn't check for overflows or underflows when it modifies balances in the `Deposit` and `Collect` functions. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds. SafeMath library or similar should be used for arithmetic operations.

4. Unchecked Return Values: The return value of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is not checked. If this call fails for whatever reason, the contract will not be aware of it. This can lead to inconsistent state.

5. Denial of Service: If a contract is called with the `call.value()` function and that contract throws an error or consumes all the gas, it could block all the ether in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable in this contract.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable in this contract.

8. Time manipulation: The `LogFile` contract uses `now` for timestamping messages. Miners can manipulate timestamps to some degree, which might affect the order of messages in the log.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable in this contract.
