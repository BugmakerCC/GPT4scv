Upon analyzing the given smart contract, the following vulnerabilities can be detected:

1. Reentrancy: This contract does not seem to have a reentrancy vulnerability as it does not make any external calls after updating the state.

2. Access Control: The contract has access control vulnerability. The functions `endRaffle`, `togglePause` and `kill` can only be called by the `feeAddress`, which is set during contract creation and can't be changed. If the owner's address is compromised, it can lead to a loss of control over the contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: No obvious arithmetic issues or under/overflows are found in the contract.

4. Unchecked Return Values: This contract does not check the return value of `transfer()`, so if a transfer fails, the contract will continue running.

5. Denial of Service: The contract is vulnerable to gas limit DoS attacks. The `getRefund` and `endRaffle` functions have loops that can iterate over an arbitrarily large number of contestants. If the number of contestants is too large, these functions may exceed the block gas limit.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses a weak source of randomness in the `chooseWinner` function. It relies on block variables (`block.coinbase` and `block.difficulty`) and `msg.sender`, which can be manipulated by miners or users to some extent.

7. Front-Running: The `buyTickets` function may be vulnerable to front-running, as a malicious miner could see a transaction in the transaction pool and insert their own transaction to buy the last ticket.

8. Time Manipulation: Doesn't seem to have a time manipulation vulnerability since the contract does not rely on `block.timestamp`.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract does not seem to be vulnerable to short address attacks as it does not take address inputs from function calls.
