The provided smart contract seems to have some of the vulnerabilities mentioned. Here are some of them:

1. **Reentrancy**: The `WithdrawToHolder` function makes a `.call.value()` function call to an external address. This could potentially open up a reentrancy vulnerability if the `_addr` is a contract address and the fallback function of the contract calls back into the `WithdrawToHolder` function. This could be more secure by using `address.transfer()` or `address.send()` functions that only forwards 2300 gas to the recipient contract, which is not enough to perform any state changing operations.

2. **Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls**: The contract uses `.call()` in `WithdrawToken` and `WithdrawToHolder` functions. The return value of `.call()` is not checked, which means it doesn't care whether the call succeeds or not. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

3. **Access Control**: The `onlyOwner` modifier is intended to restrict access to certain functions to the contract's owner. However, it has a flaw. The modifier should use `require(msg.sender == owner)` to throw an exception when the condition is not met. But in the current implementation, the modifier does nothing if the sender is not the owner, and the function will continue to execute.

4. **Arithmetic Issues**: In `Deposit` function, there is no check for overflow when adding `msg.value` to `Holders[msg.sender]`. This might lead to integer overflow.

5. **Denial of Service**: There is a potential Denial of Service attack in `WitdrawTokenToHolder` and `WithdrawToHolder`. If the `_to` or `_addr` is a contract that has a fallback function which fails or consumes a lot of gas, then it can block these functions from completing.

These are potential vulnerabilities and it's recommended to fix them to ensure the safety and security of the smart contract.
