This smart contract has a couple of vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function CashOut has a reentrancy vulnerability. The contract interacts with an external contract (via msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) before it adjusts its state (balances[msg.sender] -= _am). If the external contract calls back into CashOut, it could withdraw more Ether than it should be able to.

2. Arithmetic Issue: There is a risk of integer underflow in the function CashOut. If _am > balances[msg.sender], balances[msg.sender] -= _am will underflow and result in a very large balance for the msg.sender.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The return value of the low-level call, msg.sender.call.value(_am)() is not checked, meaning that the call could fail silently. If this happens, it would lead to the function concluding successfully and the log reflecting a cash out, but in reality, no transfer would have occurred.

4. Access Control: There is no access control on functions. Anyone can call the AddMessage function in the Log contract. 

5. Denial of Service (DoS): This contract is vulnerable to DoS by unexpected revert. An attacker can create a contract that always reverts in its fallback function and then make a deposit from that contract. When the contract tries to cash out, the call will always fail and the funds will be stuck in the contract.

Overall, these vulnerabilities make the smart contract unsafe and susceptible to exploits and attacks.
