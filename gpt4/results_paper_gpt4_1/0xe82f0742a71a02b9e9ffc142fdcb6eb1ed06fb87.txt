The given smart contract has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `GetFreebie` function is susceptible to a reentrancy attack. It first transfers `this.balance` to the `Owner` and then to `msg.sender`. An attacker could become the `msg.sender` and initiate a fallback function to call `GetFreebie` again before the first call is finished, draining the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: The `withdraw` function has an access control vulnerability. It allows the `Owner` of the contract to be changed if `msg.sender` is a specific address.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the code, hence no overflow or underflow issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `Command` function uses `.call()`, a low-level function, and does not check its return value. If this call fails, the contract will not be aware of it.

5. Denial of Service: The contract could potentially be locked by an attacker if they manage to force a fail in the `GetFreebie` function, making the funds inaccessible.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract doesn't rely on any randomness, hence no vulnerability in this respect.

7. Front-Running: The `GetFreebie` function could be susceptible to front-running. An attacker could see a transaction calling this function and then offer a higher gas price to get their own transaction mined first.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on block timestamps or any time-related logic, hence no vulnerability in this respect.

9. Short Address Attack: There are no external calls to untrusted contracts with `msg.data` as input, hence no vulnerability in this respect.
