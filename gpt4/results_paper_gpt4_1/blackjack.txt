The given smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Bad Randomness (Common Vulnerability): The contract is using block variables (block.number and block.timestamp) in the "deal" function to generate a pseudo-random number. These variables are publicly visible on the blockchain which means they can be manipulated by miners. The function "keccak256" is used to hash the block number, player address, card number, and timestamp to generate a random number. However, this also can be predicted, especially by a miner who has control over the blockhash and timestamp.

2. Denial of Service: In the "stand" function and "checkGameResult" function, the contract sends Ether to msg.sender without checking the return value of the send function. If the recipient contract throws an exception, the send function will return false but the state of the game will not be changed back, causing funds to be locked in the contract.

3. Access Control: There is no access control to prevent unauthorized access to critical functions (e.g., deal, hit, stand). Anybody can call these functions and manipulate the game.

4. Reentrancy: This contract does not seem to have a reentrancy issue, but it's worth noting that calling external contracts (like the send function does) can potentially open up for reentrancy attacks. The contract does not use the recommended .transfer() method to send ether.

5. Arithmetic Issues: This contract does not seem to have any arithmetic issues such as integer overflow or underflow.

6. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract does not check the return value of the send function.

7. Front-Running: This contract might be vulnerable to front-running attacks. The deal function which is called to start the game can be front-run by a miner who can manipulate the block variables that are used to generate the random number.

8. Timestamp Dependence: The contract uses block.timestamp (now) for generating random numbers. This can be manipulated by miners to some extent.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract does not seem to have any short address attack vulnerabilities as it does not directly interact with user-provided addresses.

Please note that this analysis might not be exhaustive and the contract should be thoroughly tested.
