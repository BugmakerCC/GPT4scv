The smart contract has a couple of vulnerabilities that could be exploited:

1. Reentrancy: The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it first sends Ether with a call.value()() and then updates the state of the contract. An attacker contract could fallback on a function to call `CashOut` again before the original `CashOut` call has a chance to finish, causing it to withdraw more Ether than they should.

2. Access Control: The contract uses `tx.origin` for access control in the `onlyOwner` modifier. This is a security risk as `tx.origin` can be manipulated by a malicious contract. It's recommended to use `msg.sender` instead of `tx.origin` for access control.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses `call.value()()`, a low-level call, in the `CashOut` function without checking its return value. If the call fails, the contract won't revert and the state won't be updated, which could lead to loss of funds.

4. Denial of Service: An attacker could create a contract that always fails when receiving Ether. The attacker then deposits Ether into the PrivateDeposit contract and the contract will be unable to release the Ether to the attacker, causing a Denial of Service.

5. Time manipulation: The contract uses `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) in the `AddMessage` function in the Log contract. Miners can manipulate `block.timestamp` within a certain range and that could affect the contract's behavior.

6. The contract does not have any vulnerability regarding integer overflow and underflow, bad randomness, front-running, and short address attack. 

The contract might be improved by adding checks for the return value of `call.value()()`, by using a reentrancy guard for the `CashOut` function, using `msg.sender` for access control, and not using `block.timestamp` for critical logic.
