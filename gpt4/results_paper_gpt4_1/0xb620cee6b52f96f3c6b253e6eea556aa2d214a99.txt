After analyzing the provided Solidity smart contract, here are the identified vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `manipulateSecret` and `claimPrize` functions are vulnerable to reentrancy attacks since they call `msg.sender.transfer()` before changing the state of the contract. An attacker could recursively call these functions to drain the contract's funds.

2. Access Control: All functions that are restricted to `onlyPlayers` can be called by anyone who sends the correct amount of Ether due to the `becomePlayer` function. This is because the `becomePlayer` function does not have any restrictions on who can become a player.

3. Arithmetic Issues: In the `guessSeed` function, there is an integer division operation that could potentially lead to an underflow if `seed[0]` or `seed[1]` are 0.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: `firstTarget.call.value(msg.value)()` and `secondTarget.call.value(msg.value)()` are not checking the return values of these calls. If these calls fail, the contract will not be aware of it.

5. Denial of Service: The `winPrize` function could potentially be used to perform a denial of service attack by making the `owner.call.value(1 wei)()` call fail. This would prevent the owner from winning the prize.

6. Bad Randomness: The `unlockSecret` function uses `blockhash(block.number-1)` as a source of randomness, which can be manipulated by miners.

7. Front-Running: The `guessSeed` function could be vulnerable to front-running attacks by a malicious miner who could see the guessed seed before it is mined and then make a transaction with the correct guess.

8. Time Manipulation: No apparent time manipulation vulnerability is detected in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: No apparent short address attack vulnerability is detected in this contract. However, it's always a best practice to validate the length of addresses.
