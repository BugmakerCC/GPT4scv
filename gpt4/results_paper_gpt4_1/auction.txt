The provided smart contract is susceptible to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. This vulnerability is caused by the fact that if a frontrunner's fallback function always fails, they will always win the auction as the transaction will be reverted. 

Here's how the vulnerability works: when a new bid comes in, the contract first checks if it's higher than the current bid. If it is, it attempts to refund the current frontrunner their bid through a `.send()` function. If this send operation fails (for instance, if the frontrunner's account is designed to always reject transactions), the entire `bid()` transaction will be reverted. This means that a malicious frontrunner could effectively block any new bids and be sure to win the auction, even if higher bids are being made.

To fix this vulnerability, you could first update the current frontrunner and the current bid, and only then attempt to refund the previous frontrunner. This way, even if the refund fails, the new bid will have been registered. 

This contract does not seem to have other vulnerabilities listed above. It does not have reentrancy vulnerability as there are no external contract calls within a function, no access control issues as there are no restricted functions or variables, no arithmetic issues as no arithmetic operations are performed, no unchecked return values as the return value of all low level calls are checked, no bad randomness as no random numbers are used, no front-running as the same function is not being called multiple times within a single transaction, no time manipulation as timestamps are not used, and no short address attack as no short addresses are used. However, complete security can only be guaranteed through a thorough audit that includes all possible attack vectors, not just the ones mentioned above.
