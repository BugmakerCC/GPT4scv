This smart contract appears to have a few potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `Collect()` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The contract sends ether with `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` before it reduces the balance of the sender (`balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`). This allows the recipient to call back into `Collect()` before `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` is executed.

2. Access Control: The functions `SetMinSum()`, `SetLogFile()`, and `Initialized()` can be called by any address because there are no access control mechanisms in place. This allows any address to change the `MinSum`, `Log`, and `intitalized` values. 

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not prevent overflow or underflow issues. For instance, if `_am` in the `Collect()` function is greater than `balances[msg.sender]`, it can result in underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values: The contract does not check the return value of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. If this call fails, the contract does not handle it.

5. Denial of Service: If an attacker were to manipulate their fallback function to always throw an exception, they could permanently prevent their funds from being withdrawn.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable, as the contract does not use any randomness.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable, as the contract does not involve any transactions that could take advantage of timing or transaction ordering.

8. Time Manipulation: Not applicable, as the contract does not rely on `block.timestamp` or `now` for critical operations.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable, as the contract does not take in address parameters that could be shortened. 

Please note that this is a high-level analysis and a more detailed audit would be required to ensure the contract's safety.
