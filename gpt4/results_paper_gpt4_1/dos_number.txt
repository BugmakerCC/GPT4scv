This contract seems to have the Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to the gas limit, particularly in the `insertNnumbers` function and `clearDOS` function. 

1. In `insertNnumbers` function, if the `numbers` parameter passed is significantly large, it could consume all available gas leading to a DoS condition. This is because the function continuously inserts `numbers` into the `array` without checking the gas limit.

2. In `clearDOS` function, it also creates a potential DoS condition. If `numElements` is significantly large, clearing the entire array might consume more gas than the block gas limit, causing the transaction to fail.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, you could limit the number of items that can be processed in a single transaction, thus ensuring that each operation consumes a predictable amount of gas. You could also implement a mechanism to allow users to manually handle these operations in smaller chunks that would not exceed the gas limit.

However, the contract does not seem to have issues related to Reentrancy, Access Control, Arithmetic Issues, Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation or Short Address Attack, based on the provided code.

Remember that this analysis assumes the context and surrounding infrastructure in which this contract is used does not introduce additional vulnerabilities. For instance, if this contract is used by another contract that introduces timestamp dependency, then the Time manipulation vulnerability could be introduced. It's always important to analyze not just individual contracts, but the entire ecosystem in which they're used.
