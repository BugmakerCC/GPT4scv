The smart contract is vulnerable to the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy because there is no external call that could allow for re-entrancy.

2. Access Control: The smart contract does not have proper access control mechanisms. The `owner` state variable is public which makes it readable by any external contract or account.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract is not vulnerable to integer underflow or overflow issues as there are no arithmetic operations that could lead to such vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not check the return value of `transfer` which could lead to funds getting locked in the contract if the transfer fails.

5. Denial of Service: The contract could be susceptible to a denial of service attack if an attacker can keep the `claimed` variable false by constantly sending transactions that fail the `require` statement.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract is not using any randomness so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract is vulnerable to front-running as the order of transactions could be manipulated by miners. This is because the `claimReward` function can be front run by another transaction that changes the state of the contract.

8. Time manipulation: The contract is not vulnerable to time manipulation as it does not rely on timestamps or block numbers.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract is not vulnerable to short address attacks as it does not make raw `msg.data` calls which could be manipulated. 

In summary, this contract is vulnerable to Access Control, Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls, Denial of Service, and Front-Running. Proper checks and control measures need to be implemented to mitigate these risks.
