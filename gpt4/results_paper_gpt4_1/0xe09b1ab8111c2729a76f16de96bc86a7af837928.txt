Here is a review of the potential vulnerabilities in the given smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: Although there are several external calls, none of them are followed by a state change and hence, there is no reentrancy vulnerability.

2. Access Control: The contract seems to have proper access control measures in place. Only the owner can change the bot address, the secret signer, and can withdraw the developer fee. The bot also has specific privileges. However, it would be advisable to keep a track of all the owners and bots for better security.

3. Arithmetic Issues: Solidity automatically throws an exception when an integer overflow or underflow occurs, so this contract does not have this vulnerability.

4. Unchecked Return Values: There might be a potential vulnerability in the `whale.call.value(donate_amount)(bytes4(keccak256("donate()")));` call as its return value is not checked. If the call fails, the contract continues to execute, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

5. Denial of Service: No apparent DoS vulnerabilities can be observed in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses `keccak256` for generating random numbers, which is considered insecure because miners can potentially influence the outcome.

7. Front-running: This contract might be susceptible to front-running as the `wager` function which accepts bets is public and miners could potentially manipulate the order of transactions.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses `block.number` for checking bet expiration, which can be manipulated by miners to a certain degree.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not appear to be vulnerable to a short address attack as it does not deal with raw transfer functions.

Additional considerations:

- The contract uses a low-level `call` function to interact with the `whale` address. This is potentially unsafe and could open up reentrancy vulnerabilities if the `whale` contract is malicious or compromised. It is recommended to use Solidity's `transfer` or `send` functions instead.
- The contract does not implement a circuit breaker (also known as a pause or emergency stop mechanism), which is a design pattern that allows contract functionality to be stopped (except for the withdrawal of funds) in case of an emergency or if a bug is discovered.
- The contract does not emit an event when the `whale` address is updated, which is recommended for better transparency and auditability.
- The contract uses `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) for time calculation. This can be manipulated by miners up to a certain degree.
