Looking at your provided smart contract, it seems to have the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The contract updates the balance of the msg.sender only after the external call to msg.sender. This allows the recipient to call `CashOut` recursively before the balance is updated.

2. Denial of Service: The `CashOut` function uses a low level `call.value()` method. This can lead to a denial of service attack if the recipient contract falls, hence making the `msg.sender` unable to withdraw their funds.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The return value of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is not checked in the `CashOut` function. If the call fails for some reason, the contract will continue execution without any error.

4. Access Control: The function `AddMessage` in the `Log` contract is public and doesn't have any restrictions on who can call it. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access.

5. Arithmetic Issues: There are no checks for overflows or underflows in the `Deposit` function when adding the deposited amount to the sender's balance. This could lead to potential arithmetic issues.

6. Front-Running: Also, potential front-running attacks could happen as external users can see transactions and their details before they are mined.

The contract does not appear to have issues with bad randomness, time manipulation, and short address attack. However, it is recommended to use tools like Mythril, Oyente, or Slither for a more comprehensive and automated vulnerability check.
