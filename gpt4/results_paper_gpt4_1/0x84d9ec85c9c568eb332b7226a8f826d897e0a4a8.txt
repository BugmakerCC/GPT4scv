After evaluating the smart contract, here are potential vulnerabilities and issues:

1. Reentrancy: The contract doesn't seem to have a reentrancy vulnerability as there aren't any calls to external contracts within a function where the state has been changed but not yet saved. 

2. Access Control: The contract seems to have a potential vulnerability in access control. The function `writeIndex` is public, which means any address can call it, potentially leading to unauthorized changes in the contract state.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in this contract, so it doesn't appear to be vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses the `call.value()` function in the `execute` function, which is a low-level call that can potentially fail without throwing an exception. The return value of this call is not checked, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

5. Denial of Service: There doesn't seem to be a direct risk of Denial of Service attacks in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: There is no randomness used in the contract, so no issues here.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not seem to be susceptible to front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`), which can be manipulated by miners to some degree. However, in this contract context it's not a significant issue.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract does not seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack. 

Please note that these findings are based on the provided code snippet. There might be other issues or vulnerabilities if we consider the whole environment in which this contract is used. It's always recommended to conduct a comprehensive security audit before deploying any smart contract in a production environment.
