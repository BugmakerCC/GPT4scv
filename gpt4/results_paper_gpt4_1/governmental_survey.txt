Looking at the provided smart contract, the following vulnerabilities can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability is present in the `resetInvestment()` function of the `Governmental` contract. When the `send()` function is used, the control is handed over to an external contract which can lead to re-entry into the `resetInvestment()` function before the state variables `lastInvestor` and `jackpot` are set to their initial values. This means the attacker can drain the contract funds.

2. Access Control: The `resetInvestment()` function is open to any address, not just the owner or lastInvestor. This means that any user can call the function and potentially drain the contract balance.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There do not appear to be any arithmetic issues as all the math operations are straightforward with no chances of overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `send()` function's return value is not checked in the `resetInvestment()` function, which can lead to lost funds if the send operation fails.

5. Denial of Service: The `resetInvestment()` function could potentially cause a denial of service if the `send()` function fails and throws an exception.

6. Bad Randomness: It doesn't seem like this contract relies on randomness, so this vulnerability isn't applicable here.

7. Front-Running: The contract could be vulnerable to front-running attacks but it's not explicit in this example.

8. Time manipulation: The `resetInvestment()` function of the `Governmental` contract is dependent on the `block.timestamp` variable which can be manipulated by miners to some extent.

9. Short Address Attack: There's no direct interaction with user-provided addresses that could be manipulated to be shorter than expected, so this vulnerability isn't applicable here. 

The `Attacker` contract seems to be designed to exploit the reentrancy vulnerability by recursively calling the `attack()` function and then calling `resetInvestment()` function to drain the funds.
