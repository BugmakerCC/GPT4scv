The DEP_BANK contract contains the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: In the Collect function, the contract sends Ether (msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) before it reduces the balance of the sender (balances[msg.sender]-=_am;). This ordering allows for a reentrancy attack. A malicious contract could fallback on its function to call the Collect function again before the first call is finished, and withdraw more ether than it should.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: msg.sender.call.value(_am)() can fail silently. If the call fails for whatever reason (the recipient is a contract which throws an exception in its fallback function, the recipient is a contract which consumes all the gas, etc.), the contract's state would not revert. 

3. Access Control: The contract has functions like SetMinSum, SetLogFile, and Initialized that can be called by any address because they lack a modifier to restrict access to only the owner. This can lead to unauthorized changes in the contract's state.

4. Denial of Service: If an attacker creates a contract with a fallback function that always throws, and then sends Ether from that contract to this contract, it will make the Collect function unavailable for all users, because msg.sender.call.value(_am)() will always throw an exception.

5. Time manipulation: The contract uses the 'now' keyword to get the current timestamp for logging. Miners have slight control over this value, which can lead to time manipulation attacks.

The contract does not appear to have vulnerabilities related to Arithmetic Issues, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, or Short Address Attack. However, the absence of these vulnerabilities in this analysis does not mean they could not be introduced with changes to the contract, so always be vigilant.
