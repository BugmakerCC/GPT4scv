The smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The withdraw function in the VaultProxy contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. A malicious contract can reenter the function before the state (the Deposits mapping) is updated.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The proxy function in the Proxy contract uses a low-level call without checking its return value. If the call fails, the contract will not be aware of it.

3. Access Control: The onlyOwner modifier is defined in the Proxy contract but it checks the Owner state variable of the Proxy contract, not the VaultProxy contract. This can create confusion and potential access control issues. 

4. Arithmetic Issues: In the deposit() function, the smart contract does not handle potential overflows when adding msg.value to Deposits[msg.sender].

5. Denial of Service: The deposit() function only accepts payments above 0.5 ether. This could be used to implement a Denial-of-Service attack by repeatedly sending amounts less than 0.5 ether.

6. Time Manipulation: Although this vulnerability is not directly present in the contract, the use of block properties (like timestamp) can introduce this vulnerability. This contract does not use any such properties, so it's safe from this particular vulnerability.

7. Bad Randomness: This contract does not use any randomness, so it's safe from this particular vulnerability.

8. Front-running: This contract does not have any transaction ordering dependence, so it's safe from this particular vulnerability.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not perform explicit input length checks which could potentially expose it to short address attacks. However, these attacks are typically mitigated by the Ethereum client which pads shorter addresses.

It is recommended to use the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, use the pull-over-push pattern for withdrawals to prevent reentrancy, check return values of low-level calls, and have clear and secure access control mechanisms.
