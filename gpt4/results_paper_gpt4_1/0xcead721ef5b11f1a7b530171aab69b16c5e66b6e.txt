After reviewing the given smart contract, we can identify the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. In the `Collect` function, the contract calls an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`), before it reduces the balance of the account (`acc.balance-=_am;`). This could allow a malicious contract to continuously trigger the `Collect` function before the first invocation of the function has finished executing, resulting in a withdrawal of more Ether than the account holds.

2. Access Control: There are no access control checks present in the contract. Any address can call `Put` or `Collect` functions, and also change the `LogFile` by calling `WALLET`. This can potentially lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not handle potential overflows or underflows. This could lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with large numbers.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not check the return value of the low level call `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. If this call fails, the contract will continue to execute.

5. Denial of Service: The DoS vulnerability could potentially occur in the `Collect` function. If the `msg.sender` is a contract that throws an exception in its fallback function, it would make the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` always fail, making Ether stuck in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable - the contract does not rely on randomness.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable - the contract does not use any mechanisms that could be exploited by front-running.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses `now` keyword, which can be manipulated by miners to a certain degree. This could potentially affect the behaviour of the `Put` and `Collect` functions.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable - the contract does not call external contracts with msg.data or use assembly code to manually load function arguments.

Please note that this analysis might not be exhaustive, and further auditing may be necessary to ensure the contract is secure.
