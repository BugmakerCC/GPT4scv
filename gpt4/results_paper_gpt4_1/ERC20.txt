The smart contract seems to be well-written and it uses the OpenZeppelin library for secure mathematical operations, which prevents Arithmetic Issues such as integer overflow and underflow. However, there are a few potential vulnerabilities that need to be addressed:

1. Reentrancy: This contract doesn't seem to have any reentrancy issues since all the state changes are done before external calls.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any functionality to restrict access to certain functions, which is a potential vulnerability. In the current state, anyone could interact with the contract.

3. Unchecked Return Values: The contract does not have any low-level calls like call.value(), so there is no risk of unchecked return values.

4. Denial of Service: There doesn't seem to be a risk of DoS in this contract, as there are no loops that could potentially result in gas limit issues. 

5. Bad Randomness: The contract does not rely on randomness, removing the risk of this vulnerability.

6. Front-Running: This is a potential vulnerability in this contract. An attacker could potentially observe a transaction that calls the `transferFrom` function and then front-run that transaction by sending another `transferFrom` transaction with a higher gas price.

7. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps, removing the risk of this vulnerability.

8. Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to this attack since it does not take the length of the address from the user input directly.

In conclusion, the contract seems to be vulnerable to Front-Running and Access Control issues.
