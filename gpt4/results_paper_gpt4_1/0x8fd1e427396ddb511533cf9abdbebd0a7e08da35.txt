This smart contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability is present in the "WithdrawToHolder" function. It uses the call.value() function which is a low-level call that may enable reentrancy attacks due to the control flow of the contract. The balance of the holder is updated after the call, allowing a potential attacker to reenter the function and withdraw more than they should.

2. Access Control: The modifier "onlyOwner" does not prevent the execution of the function if the sender is not the owner. It just continues with the execution, making the modifier useless and allowing non-owners to use owner-only functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There is a potential underflow in the "WithdrawToHolder" function. If the _wei value is greater than the balance of the holder, the balance would be a very large number due to underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The low level calls in the "WithdrawToken" and "WithdrawToHolder" functions do not check the return value of the call function. This can cause the contract to silently fail and continue execution.

5. Denial of Service: The contract has a potential for Denial of Service (DoS) attack through the "changeOwner" function. An attacker could set the 'newOwner' to an address they control, then refuse to call the 'confirmOwner' function.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable since the contract does not use any randomness.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable since the contract does not have any transaction ordering dependence.

8. Time manipulation: Not applicable as the contract does not rely on time-based calculations.

9. Short Address Attack: This isn't directly applicable as the contract does not interact with user-supplied addresses in a way that would make it vulnerable to short address attacks. However, the contract's lax access controls and lack of input validation could be leveraged to pass in a short address to exploit other contracts that it interacts with.
