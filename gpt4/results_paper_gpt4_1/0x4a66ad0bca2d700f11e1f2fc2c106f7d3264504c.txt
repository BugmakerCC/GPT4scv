After analyzing the provided smart contract, I have found the following vulnerabilities:

1. Unchecked Return Values: The smart contract uses the low level `.call()` function to call `transferFrom(address,address,uint256)` but it does not check the return value of this function call. Therefore, if the `transferFrom` function call fails for any reason, the contract will not be aware of the failure and will continue execution.

2. Access Control: The `transfer` function checks if the `msg.sender` is a specific address (0x9797055B68C5DadDE6b3c7d5D80C9CFE2eecE6c9) before allowing the function to be executed. However, the contract does not have a mechanism to change this address if needed. If the private key for this address is lost or compromised, the `transfer` function becomes useless or can be misused.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The `transfer` function multiplies the input `v[i]` by a constant. If a large enough value is inputted for `v[i]`, this can cause an integer overflow.

There doesn't appear to be a reentrancy, denial of service, bad randomness, front-running, time manipulation, or short address attack vulnerability in this contract. However, please note that the absence of these vulnerabilities in my report does not guarantee that they do not exist. A more thorough audit by an experienced security professional may still be needed.
