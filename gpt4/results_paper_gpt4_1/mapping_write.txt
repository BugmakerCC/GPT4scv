The smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Access Control: There is an access control issue in this contract. The contract's constructor is missing, meaning that the 'owner' variable is never set. Because of this, the owner variable defaults to the zero address (0x0), which means no one can call the "withdraw" function. The owner should be set to the address deploying the contract in the constructor.

2. Arithmetic Issues: It is possible for an arithmetic issue to occur in this contract. Specifically, an integer overflow can occur when "key" is set to a very large number. This could result in the map length being set to a smaller value than expected, which could potentially overwrite existing entries in the map. 

3. Denial of Service: The contract does not have a proper mechanism to prevent a Denial of Service attack. As an example, if the owner address is a contract that has a fallback function which consumes a lot of gas, the transfer function in the withdraw function can go out of gas, causing the execution to stop and the funds to be locked in the contract forever.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The "transfer" function does not check its return value. In Solidity, the "transfer" function will throw an exception if the call fails, but if the fallback function of the recipient contract requires more than 2300 gas, the transfer will silently fail.

These are the main vulnerabilities of the contract. The others listed (Reentrancy, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, Short Address Attack) do not seem to be present in this contract.
