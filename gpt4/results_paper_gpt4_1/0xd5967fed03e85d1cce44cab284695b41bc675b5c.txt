The given smart contract is susceptible to the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract uses a low-level `.call()` function without proper mitigation against reentrancy attacks. Reentrancy attack can happen when an attacker's contract is able to call back into the calling contract before the first invocation of the function is finished. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior such as double-spending.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The smart contract uses the low-level `.call()` function but does not check its return value. This could allow an attacker to cause the call to fail and potentially execute malicious code.

3. Access Control: The `transfer` function does not have any access control mechanisms in place. This means that any address can call the function and trigger the transfer of tokens.

4. Denial of Service: An attacker could potentially cause the `transfer` function to run out of gas if the `_tos` array is large. This could result in a denial of service where legitimate users are unable to interact with the contract.

The contract does not seem to have issues with Arithmetic, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, and Short Address Attack. However, it is always recommended to have a thorough audit of the contract by a professional auditor to ensure its security.
