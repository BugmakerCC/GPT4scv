The smart contract provided is vulnerable to the following issues:

1. Reentrancy: This contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to reentrancy attack as there are no external calls followed by state changes.

2. Access Control: The contract seems to have a strong access control mechanism, with multiple modifiers checking for ownership and authorization. However, thorough testing is needed to confirm this.

3. Arithmetic Issues: Underflow or Overflow can occur in conditions like `m_spentToday + _value >= m_spentToday` and `m_spentToday + _value += _value`. SafeMath library should be used for arithmetic operations.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: Low level calls like `_to.call.value(_value)(_data)` and `m_txs[_h].to.call.value(m_txs[_h].value)(m_txs[_h].data)` are unchecked. This could lead to unexpected behavior.

5. Denial of Service: There doesn't seem to be any clear DoS vulnerabilities in this contract.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not rely on randomness so this is not applicable.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to front-running as it does not rely on transaction ordering.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses `now` keyword (alias for `block.timestamp`), which can be manipulated by miners to some degree.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not appear to directly handle raw addresses in a manner that would expose it to a short address attack. 

The contract seems to be based on the Parity Multisig Wallet which had a critical vulnerability that led to millions of dollars in Ether being stolen. The vulnerability was related to the `initWallet` function, which could be called by any user, not just the contract creator. This issue doesn't seem to be present in this version of the contract, but it's worth noting the history. 

Please note that this analysis is not exhaustive and further, more detailed security audits should be conducted.
