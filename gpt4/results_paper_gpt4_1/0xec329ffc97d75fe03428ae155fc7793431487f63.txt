The smart contract has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy:
There doesn't seem to be a direct reentrancy issue. The contract does not make any external calls after changing its own state.

2. Access Control:
The contract has an appropriate access control in place using the `onlyOwner` modifier. However, there is no check or confirmation for the `changeOwner` function. It's possible that an owner could accidentally pass in the wrong address, resulting in loss of control over the contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues:
The contract does not handle potential overflow or underflow issues. This can occur in the `fill` function when calculating `acc += amount;` and `totalToDistribute += acc;`.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls:
The contract uses a low-level `.call` method in the `execute` function of the `Owned` contract without checking its return value. This could potentially lead to failed calls without the contract being aware.

5. Denial of Service:
The `run` function could be susceptible to a Block Gas Limit DoS if the `transfers` array is too large. If a transaction runs out of gas halfway, it will always fail because the function requires at least 150,000 gas.

6. Bad Randomness:
Not applicable, the contract does not use random numbers.

7. Front-Running:
Not applicable, the contract does not have any transaction ordering dependence.

8. Time manipulation:
Not applicable, the contract does not depend on timestamps or block numbers.

9. Short Address Attack:
Not directly applicable, the contract does not directly interact with user-supplied addresses. However, it does not verify if the `Token` contract address supplied is correct or safe.

As a final note, it's generally unsafe to use the `throw` keyword in Solidity as it consumes all the remaining gas. Consider using `require` or `revert` instead.
