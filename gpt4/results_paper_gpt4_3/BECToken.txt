This smart contract has one of the nine common vulnerabilities mentioned, which is the "Batch Overflow" vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs in the `batchTransfer` function of the `PausableToken` contract. 

```solidity
function batchTransfer(address[] _receivers, uint256 _value) public whenNotPaused returns (bool) {
    uint cnt = _receivers.length;
    
    uint256 amount = uint256(cnt) * _value;
    require(cnt > 0 && cnt <= 20);
    require(_value > 0 && balances[msg.sender] >= amount);

    balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(amount);
    for (uint i = 0; i < cnt; i++) {
        balances[_receivers[i]] = balances[_receivers[i]].add(_value);
        Transfer(msg.sender, _receivers[i], _value);
    }
    return true;
}
```

The vulnerability lies in the calculation of the `amount` variable. If `_value` is a very large number (specifically, greater than `2^256 / cnt`), the multiplication will overflow and `amount` will be a very small number. This will pass the check `balances[msg.sender] >= amount`, even if the sender's balance is not enough. In the following code, `_value` will be added to each receiver's balance, leading to the minting of a huge amount of new tokens, which could lead to a massive hyperinflation attack on the token's economy.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by adding a condition to check whether `_value` times `cnt` is less than or equal to the maximum possible uint256 value, which is `2^256 - 1`. 

The rest of the code does not seem to have the other eight vulnerabilities mentioned.
