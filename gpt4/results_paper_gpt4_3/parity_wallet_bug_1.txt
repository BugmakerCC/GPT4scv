This smart contract seems to have potential security vulnerabilities in the following areas:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not seem to have direct reentrancy vulnerability because it doesn't seem to call external contracts in the middle of state-changing functions. However, this could still be a potential issue with the use of delegatecall in the fallback function.

2. Access Control: The contract has multiple owners which are managed through multiple functions. The access control seems to be handled well, but it's a complex system and there could be some hidden issues.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract uses simple addition and subtraction for balance and limit calculations. This could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow issues. It's recommended to use SafeMath library to avoid such issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses low level delegatecall function in the fallback function and doesn't check the return value which could lead to unexpected behavior.

5. Denial of Service: The function "removeOwner" could potentially be abused by majority owners to remove the minority, which could lead to a DOS condition.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract doesn't seem to use any randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to front-running as it doesn't seem to have any transaction ordering dependence.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses "now" keyword for time which could be manipulated by miners.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to short address attack as it doesn't seem to directly handle user-supplied addresses.

It's recommended to have a professional security audit to uncover potential hidden issues.
