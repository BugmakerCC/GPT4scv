The identified contract has a Reentrancy vulnerability.

Reentrancy threat arises when a contract sends Ether with a call.value()() command without first setting its internal state. This contract allows for recursive calls by external contracts. The msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)() call can be a potential security threat because it invokes the fallback function on the msg.sender address. If this address is a malicious contract, it could call the withdrawAll() function recursively, draining the contract of its Ether.

Here is the scenario that can be exploited: 

1. The attacker deposits 1 Ether into the contract, which increases their credit[msg.sender] by 1 and the contract's balance by 1.
2. The attacker invokes the withdrawAll() function. If the contract's balance is more than the attacker's credit, the contract's balance is decreased by the attacker's credit.
3. The contract sends the Ether back to the attacker using msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)(). This invocation calls the fallback function in the attacker's contract.
4. Within the fallback function, the attacker calls the withdrawAll() function again. Since the contract's credit[msg.sender] has not yet been set to 0, the contract thinks the attacker still has 1 Ether to withdraw.
5. This process can be repeated until the contract's balance is drained.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the state variable credit[msg.sender] should be set to 0 before the call to send Ether. Here's how the corrected withdrawAll() function might look:

```solidity
function withdrawAll() public {
    uint oCredit = credit[msg.sender];
    if (oCredit > 0) {
        credit[msg.sender] = 0;
        balance -= oCredit;
        
        bool callResult = msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)();
        require (callResult);
    }
}
```

All other vulnerabilities including Access Control, Arithmetic Issues, Unchecked Return Values, Denial of Service, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, and Short Address Attack are not immediately apparent in this contract. However, without further context such as the environment in which the contract is used, other potential vulnerabilities may remain hidden.
