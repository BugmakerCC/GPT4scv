Upon analyzing the smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities that can be identified:

1. Arithmetic Issue - Integer Underflow: There are no safe math operations implemented in the `sendCoin` function. If the `amount` is greater than `balances[msg.sender]`, the subtraction operation could underflow, leading to a very high balance for the sender.

2. Access Control: The contract lacks any access control mechanism. The contract creator doesn't have any special permissions and anyone can call any function. This could lead to unauthorized actions.

3. Unchecked Return Values: There is no check on the return value of the `sendCoin` function. If the function fails, the contract will not be aware of the failure.

4. Denial of Service: In the `sendCoin` method, if an attacker manages to force the `Transfer` event to fail by exhausting gas limits, then the contract will be stuck in a vulnerable state because the state is updated before the event is emitted.

5. Bad Randomness: This vulnerability is not present in the provided contract. 

6. Front-Running: The transaction can be susceptible to front-running attacks since the order of transactions can influence the state of the contract.

7. Time manipulation: This vulnerability is not present in the provided contract.

8. Short Address Attack: The contract is vulnerable to short address attack. If the `to` address is not the correct length, the EVM may incorrectly read the `amount` parameter due to how Solidity pads shorter-than-expected input data.

9. Reentrancy: This vulnerability is not present in the provided contract as there are no calls to external contracts.

These vulnerabilities can be fixed by implementing safe math operations, adding access control mechanisms, checking return values of functions, making state changes after external calls, preventing front-running, and validating addresses to protect against short address attacks.
