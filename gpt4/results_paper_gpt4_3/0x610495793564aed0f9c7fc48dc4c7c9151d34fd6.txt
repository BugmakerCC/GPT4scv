1. Reentrancy: This contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it uses the `call.value()` method in the `sendMoney` function. An attacker could make a recursive call back into the contract before the state is updated.

2. Access Control: In this contract, access control is implemented using the `onlyOwner` modifier. It seems to be well implemented as it checks if the `msg.sender` is the `owner` before executing the functions. However, the `owner` address itself is not modifiable which might pose an issue if the owner wants to transfer ownership.

3. Arithmetic Issues: This contract does not seem to have issues with arithmetic operations.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: `sendMoney` function uses low level call which does not check the return value. If the call fails, no exception is thrown and contract execution continues. This can lead to loss of funds.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not seem to have a denial of service vulnerability.

6. Bad Randomness: This contract does not use randomness, so it's not vulnerable to this.

7. Front-Running: There doesn't appear to be a front-running vulnerability in this contract as there are no transaction ordering dependencies.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps, so it's not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack as all address input parameters are used as target addresses for transactions and not used in mathematical operations. 

Please note that a full audit was not performed and this does not guarantee the security of this contract. It is recommended to have a full audit by a professional auditor.
