The provided smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Bad Randomness: The contract uses `blockhash` as a source of randomness. This is a known security risk, as `blockhash` is not truly random and can be influenced by miners to a certain extent. 

2. Time manipulation: The contract relies on `block.number` to determine when a guess should be settled. This introduces a time manipulation vulnerability, as miners have some control over when transactions are included in blocks.

3. Denial of Service: In the `settle` function, if `msg.sender.transfer(2 ether)` fails, the contract will be stuck. It would be safer to use a pattern like the withdrawal pattern, where each address is associated with a balance, and users call a separate function to withdraw their winnings.

4. Access Control: The contract does not properly restrict who can call the `lockInGuess` and `settle` functions. This could allow an attacker to disrupt the normal operation of the contract.

5. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: Although not a low level call, the `msg.sender.transfer(2 ether)` does not check the return value. If the call were to fail, the contract would not be aware and continue running.

6. Reentrancy: While there doesn't appear to be a reentrancy vulnerability in this particular contract, it's worth noting that calling external contracts, as in `msg.sender.transfer(2 ether)`, can sometimes introduce reentrancy vulnerabilities.

7. Front-Running: There is a potential for front-running, where someone sees a guess being made and quickly makes a transaction with a higher gas fee to 'jump the queue' and get their transaction mined first.

8. Arithmetic Issues, Short Address Attack: The provided contract does not appear to have these vulnerabilities.
