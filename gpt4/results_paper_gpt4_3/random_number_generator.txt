The detected vulnerabilities in the smart contract are:

1. Bad Randomness: The random number generator is not truly random. The 'salt' is initialized with block.timestamp which can be influenced by miners to some extent. The 'seed' for the blockhash function is dependent on variables which can be predicted (block.number, salt). The blockhash function itself can only return hashes of the 256 most recent blocks, any other query will return 0.

2. Arithmetic Issues: The function contains operations that could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow. For instance, there are divisions and modulus operations with 'salt' and 'max' that could lead to an underflow if the divisor becomes zero. 

3. Access Control: The 'random' function is marked as private, but this doesn't prevent the contract owner from calling it. If the contract owner is malicious, they can manipulate the outcome of the random function.

4. Time Manipulation: The contract uses block.timestamp (alias for now) for the 'salt'. The miner has control over this value to some extent (within 900 seconds). This allows for some degree of manipulation.

The contract does not seem to have issues with Reentrancy, Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls, Denial of Service, Front-Running, or Short Address Attack. However, the absence of these vulnerabilities does not mean the contract is secure. The issues found should be addressed to improve the contract's security.
