The smart contract provided has a Reentrancy vulnerability. 

The issue occurs in the `withdraw` function where it first sends Ether to `msg.sender` and then subtracts the `_amount` from the sender's balance. This allows a malicious contract to call `withdraw` again before `balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;` is executed. 

The attack can be performed as follows:

1. The attacker calls `donate` function to deposit some Ether into the contract.
2. The attacker calls `withdraw` function to withdraw the Ether.
3. The fallback function of the attacker's contract is triggered which again calls the `withdraw` function to drain more Ether.
4. This process is repeated until the contract's Ether is drained.

To fix this vulnerability, the balance of the user should be updated first before the transfer of the ether takes place. This makes sure that even if a reentrant call is made, the balance of the user would already have been updated, hence preventing the reentrancy attack. 

The corrected `withdraw` function would look something like this:

```solidity
function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
  if(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount) {
    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    if(!msg.sender.call.value(_amount)()) {
        revert("Transfer failed.");
    }
  }
}
```

I did not find any of the other vulnerabilities mentioned in your list in this contract.
