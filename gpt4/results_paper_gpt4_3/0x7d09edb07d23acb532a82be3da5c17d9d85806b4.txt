The contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the `payout` function. The state is not updated before the external call to `transfer`, allowing for reentrancy.

2. Access Control: The modifier `onlyOwner` is used to restrict access to certain functions. However, if the contract owner's private key is compromised, an attacker could take control of the contract.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: In the `donateToWhale` and `loseWager` functions, the contract makes a low level `.call`. The return value of this call is not checked, which means if the call fails, the contract will continue execution instead of halting.

4. Bad Randomness: The contract uses `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(blockhash(blockNumber), msg.sender))%difficulty +1` to generate a random number. This is not secure as miners could influence the outcome by manipulating the blockhash.

5. Time Manipulation: The contract uses `block.number` as a timestamp, which can be manipulated by miners. 

6. Arithmetic Issues: There is a potential for underflow/overflow in the `payout` function where the contract balance is divided by 2. If the balance is 1, the result will be 0 due to truncation in Solidity.

7. Front-running: Since Ethereum miners can see all pending transactions, they could potentially manipulate the order of transactions or delay transactions to their advantage.

8. Denial of Service: If the `whale` contract is a malicious contract and its fallback function always reverts, then the `payout` function will fail and the `PoCGame` contract will be stuck.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not validate the size of the input to `transferAnyERC20Token`, which could lead to a short address attack if a user submits an address that is fewer than 20 bytes.

To fix these vulnerabilities, the contract should use a secure source of randomness, check the return value of all external calls, implement secure access control, prevent overflow/underflow, and validate all input lengths.
