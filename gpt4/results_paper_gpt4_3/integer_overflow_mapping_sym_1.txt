This smart contract seems to have an Arithmetic issue specifically an integer underflow vulnerability. 

In Solidity, uint256 (unsigned integer) variables have a value range from 0 to 2^256 - 1. If you try to subtract a number from zero, there's no negative number to go to, so the value 'wraps' around to 2^256 - 1. This is called underflow.

In the function `init(uint256 k, uint256 v)`, there is a statement `map[k] -= v;`. If map[k] is 0 and v is greater than 0, an underflow will occur. 

This can lead to unexpected behaviors in the smart contract if not handled properly. 

To fix this, you should always check if the value you're subtracting is less than or equal to the value you're subtracting from. 

For example, you could modify the function to:

```
function init(uint256 k, uint256 v) public {
    require(map[k] >= v, "Underflow detected");
    map[k] -= v;
}
```

The `require` function will throw an error and revert all changes if the condition inside it is not met, which will prevent the underflow. 

Apart from this, I don't see any other vulnerabilities from the given list in this contract. However, please note that this doesn't mean the contract is completely secure. Other vulnerabilities not listed here may still exist.
