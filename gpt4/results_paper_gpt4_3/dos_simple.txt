The smart contract you provided suffers from Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to gas limit. The function `ifillArray()` is designed to fill the `listAddresses` array with the sender's address. If the length of `listAddresses` is less than 1500, it will try to add 350 new addresses. However, if the array already contains large number of addresses, addition of these addresses could exceed the gas limit for a block, making it impossible to add more addresses and thus blocking the contract. 

The contract does not seem to have a reentrancy, access control, arithmetic issues, unchecked return values for low level calls, bad randomness, front-running, time manipulation, or short address attack vulnerabilities. However, these assessments are based on the provided code snippet and the full context might reveal other potential vulnerabilities. 

To fix the DoS vulnerability, you could limit the number of addresses that can be added in a single transaction to a safe number that won't risk exceeding the block gas limit. A sensible gas check could be implemented to prevent the function from initiating if the gas required to execute exceeds a certain limit. Also, consider pagination or splitting the data into smaller contracts to avoid reaching gas limit.
