The smart contract provided has several vulnerabilities, including:

1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability:** This occurs in the `fundPuppets` function. The `fundPuppets` function sends funds to the `extra` addresses by using the `.call.value().gas()` method, which is a low-level function that can allow for reentrancy attacks if the callee contract has a fallback function that calls back into the calling contract.

2. **Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls:** This is found in the `fundPuppets` function and the fallback function of the `Puppet` contract. The return value of the `.call.value().gas()` is not checked. If the call fails, the contract will not be aware and this could lead to loss of funds or unexpected behavior.

3. **Denial of Service (DoS):** This is found in the `withdraw` function of both the `Splitter` and `Puppet` contracts. If the `owner` or `master` addresses are contract addresses that throw on `.transfer()`, the `withdraw` function would be stuck, leading to a DoS attack.

4. **Access Control:** The `setExtra` function in the `Splitter` contract allows any address to change the `extra` mapping, which could lead to loss of funds if an attacker changes the addresses to their own. The `newPuppet` function allows any address to deploy new Puppet contracts and add them to the `puppets` array, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

5. **Arithmetic Issues:** The `fundPuppets` function in the `Splitter` contract uses the `SafeMath.div` function to divide the `msg.value` by 4, but it does not check if `msg.value` is a multiple of 4. If it's not, the division result will be rounded down, leading to potential loss of funds due to integer underflow.

6. **Bad Randomness:** Not found in this contract.

7. **Front-Running:** Not found in this contract.

8. **Time manipulation:** Not found in this contract.

9. **Short Address Attack:** Not found in this contract. All addresses are assigned within the contract itself, so there's no room for external attackers to manipulate the input data length. 

Please note that this is a general analysis. For a detailed and precise audit, each function and line of code would need to be thoroughly examined. Further, the contract should have a better structure for managing users and use events to log important activities.
