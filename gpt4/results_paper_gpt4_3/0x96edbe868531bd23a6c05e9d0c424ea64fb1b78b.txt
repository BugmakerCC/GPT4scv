This smart contract contains several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `Collect` function sends Ether using `call.value(_am)()`. This could potentially allow for reentrancy attacks as the state (i.e., `acc.balance-=_am;`) is updated after the call.

2. Access Control: The `SetMinSum` and `SetLogFile` functions can be accessed by any address before the contract is initialized. This can lead to unauthorized changes.

3. Denial of Service: If the `Put` function is called with a large `_lockTime`, it can lock up funds indefinitely, effectively causing a Denial of Service.

4. Arithmetic Issues: There's an unchecked arithmetic operation in `acc.balance += msg.value;` and `acc.balance-=_am;`. If these operations result in underflow or overflow, it could lead to unexpected behavior.

5. Unchecked Return Values: The return value of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `Collect` function is not checked. If this call fails, the contract will not be able to handle the error.

6. Time Manipulation: The unlock time in the `Put` function is based on `now` which can be manipulated by miners.

Please consider to fix these vulnerabilities. For example, use a reentrancy guard for the `Collect` function, add appropriate access control for `SetMinSum` and `SetLogFile`, check for arithmetic underflows and overflows, handle potential failures of `call`, and avoid using `now` for critical logic.
