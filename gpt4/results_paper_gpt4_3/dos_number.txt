This smart contract potentially has several vulnerabilities:

1. Denial of Service (DoS): The `insertNnumbers` function can be abused to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. If the `numbers` parameter is a large value, it could cause the function to exceed the block gas limit, making the contract unresponsive. This is a type of gas limit DoS attack.

2. Denial of Service (DoS) with `clear` and `clearDOS` functions: Both `clear` and `clearDOS` functions require `numElements` to be greater than 1500. If this condition is not met, the function will revert, holding up any subsequent transactions in the same block that are intended to be executed after this transaction.

3. Arithmetic Issues: Although there are no explicit overflows or underflows in this code, it's important to be cautious with the arithmetic operations. For example, `numElements++` and `array.length += 1` could potentially overflow, but it would require a very large number of iterations.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: This issue doesn't seem to be present in the provided contract as there are no low level calls like `call`, `delegatecall`, `callcode`, or `send`.

5. Access Control: The contract does not impose any access control measures. Anyone can call the `insertNnumbers`, `clear`, `clearDOS` functions. Depending upon the use case of the contract, this may or may not be a vulnerability.

6. The remaining vulnerabilities including Reentrancy, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, and Short Address Attack do not seem to be present in this contract. However, depending on the contract's context and use, there might be potential threats. 

Remember, it's always best to have a thorough security audit conducted by a professional when deploying smart contracts to production.
