The smart contract provided has a Reentrancy vulnerability. 

The `airDrop` function in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract can be called recursively. This is due to the fact that before the balance of the caller is updated, the `supportsToken` modifier checks if the caller contract supports the token, and during this call, the attacker contract can call the `airDrop` function again. 

Here is how it works: 

1. The `attack` contract calls the `call` function, providing the address of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract as a parameter.
2. The `call` function of the `attack` contract calls the `airDrop` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract.
3. The `airDrop` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract, before executing, checks the modifiers `hasNoBalance` and `supportsToken`.
4. The `supportsToken` modifier calls the `supportsToken` function of the `attack` contract.
5. The `supportsToken` function of the `attack` contract calls the `airDrop` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract again.

This recursive call can lead to a reentrancy attack where the balance of the attacker can be increased more than it should be.

To fix this vulnerability, do not call external contracts while state variables are being updated. You should update state variables first and then call the external function or use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.
