Analyzing the contract:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack at the `redeem()` function. When `msg.sender.transfer(this.balance)` is called, it can allow the user to recursively call the redeem function before the balance is updated.

2. Access Control: The contract is vulnerable to access control issues. The `Command()` function allows the owner to execute arbitrary calls to any address with any data, which can be used to manipulate the contract's state in a malicious way.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic calculations in the contract, so it's not vulnerable to arithmetic issues such as integer overflow and underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses low-level call `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` in the `Command()` function. The return value is not checked, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.

5. Denial of Service: No specific DoS vulnerabilities are found in this contract.

6. Bad Randomness: There is no randomness involved in the contract, so it's not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: There is no transaction ordering dependency in this contract, so it's not vulnerable to front-running.

8. Time manipulation: There is no time-dependent function in this contract, so it's not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: There are no off-chain function calls or external contract interactions that would make it vulnerable to a short address attack.

Overall, the two main vulnerabilities are Reentrancy and Access Control. The contract should be revised to prevent these vulnerabilities from being exploited.
