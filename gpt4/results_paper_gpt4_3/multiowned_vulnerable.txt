The contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Access Control Vulnerability: The function `newOwner` does not have the `onlyOwner` modifier, which means that anyone can add a new owner. This is a serious vulnerability as it allows an attacker to grant themselves ownership of the contract, and subsequently perform any owner-only functions.

2. Denial of Service Vulnerability: In the `withdrawAll` function, if the `msg.sender` is a contract and its fallback function consumes more than the gas stipend (2300 gas), the `transfer` will fail, and the contract might be locked permanently because all ether will be stuck in it. This is because `transfer` only provides a limited amount of gas.

3. Reentrancy Vulnerability: This contract doesn't have Reentrancy vulnerability as there are no external calls followed by state changes. 

4. Arithmetic Issues, Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, and Short Address Attack: These vulnerabilities are not present in the provided contract. 

Recommendations to fix the vulnerabilities:

- Add the `onlyOwner` modifier to the `newOwner` function to ensure only existing owners can add new owners.
- Use the "checks, effects, and interactions" pattern to avoid potential DoS attacks. This involves performing all internal work first (checks and state changes), and external calls last. 
- Also, consider a withdrawal pattern, where contracts do not send ether to arbitrary addresses, but rather allow those addresses to withdraw their balance themselves. This would alleviate potential DoS issues.
