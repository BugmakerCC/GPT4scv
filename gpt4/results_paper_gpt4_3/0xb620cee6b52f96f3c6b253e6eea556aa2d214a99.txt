Looking at the provided smart contract, here are some potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `manipulateSecret` and `claimPrize` both contains a call to an external contract `msg.sender.transfer(amount)` and `winner.transfer(address(this).balance)`. This could be exploited by an attacker to initiate a reentrancy attack, where they recursively call the function before the first execution finishes, draining the contract of Ether.

2. Access Control: The contract uses `msg.sender == owner` and `msg.sender == winner` to control access to certain functions. If the owner or winner address is compromised, an attacker could take control of these functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The function `guessSeed` has potential integer overflow and underflow issues as it does not check for these conditions when performing arithmetic operations.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The function `callFirstTarget` and `callSecondTarget` uses `.call.value()` which is a low level call. The return value is not checked which can lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

5. Denial of Service: The `claimPrize` function allows the `winner` to claim all the balance. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by making the contract balance zero.

6. Bad Randomness: The `unlockSecret` function uses `blockhash(block.number-1)` for generating a secret. This is not truly random as it can be influenced by miners.

7. Front-Running: As transactions are public on the blockchain, an attacker could see a transaction that calls `setSecret`, `guessSeed`, or `manipulateSecret` and send a transaction with a higher gas price to front-run it.

8. Time Manipulation: There is no direct dependency on timestamps in this contract, so this vulnerability is not applicable here.

9. Short Address Attack: This vulnerability is not present in the provided contract as it does not depend on `msg.data.length` for transferring Ether or tokens. However, always ensure to use Solidity's `transfer`, `send` or call a well-audited token contract when transferring Ether or tokens.
