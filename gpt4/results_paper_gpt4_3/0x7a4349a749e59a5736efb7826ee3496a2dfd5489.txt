After analysing the code, it seems the smart contract is vulnerable to various types of attacks:

1. **Reentrancy**: In the "GetFreebie" and "withdraw" functions, the contract first transfers funds and then alters the state. This can lead to a reentrancy attack where, if the recipient is a malicious contract, it could call these functions again before the first call is finished, draining the contract's funds. 

2. **Access Control**: The "withdraw" function allows the owner of the contract to be changed by whoever has the address "0x7a617c2B05d2A74Ff9bABC9d81E5225C1e01004b". This can lead to a situation where the ownership of the contract is taken away from the original owner. 

3. **Unchecked Return Values**: The "Command" function makes a low-level call without checking its return value. If the call fails, the contract will not catch this error, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

4. **Denial of Service**: The "GetFreebie" function could be exploited to perform a Denial of Service attack. An attacker could send more than 1 Ether to this function to drain the contract's funds.

5. **Arithmetic Issues**: There are no integer overflows or underflows in this contract.

6. **Bad Randomness**: There are no randomness issues in the contract.

7. **Front-Running**: There are no front-running issues in the contract.

8. **Time Manipulation**: There are no timestamp dependencies, and hence no time manipulation issues in the contract.

9. **Short Address Attack**: There are no short address attack vulnerabilities in this contract. All address inputs are strictly validated. 

To mitigate these issues, consider implementing checks-effects-interactions pattern, always check the return value of external calls, and establish a more secure way to manage contract ownership.
