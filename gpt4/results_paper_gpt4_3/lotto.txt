The provided smart contract is potentially vulnerable to a number of the listed common vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract could potentially be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The function `sendToWinner()` sends `winAmount` to the `winner` address, but does not immediately set `payedOut` to `true`. If the `winner` address is a contract, it could re-enter `sendToWinner()` before `payedOut` is set to `true`, thereby draining the contract of more than the intended `winAmount`.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses `send` to transfer ether, but does not check the return value. `send` only provides 2300 gas, which may not be enough to complete the operation, in which case it will silently fail. It is safer to use the `transfer` function, which throws an exception on failure, or to check the return value of `send`.

3. Denial of Service: The `withdrawLeftOver` function allows any user to withdraw the remaining balance after payout. If the `payedOut` variable is set to true, an attacker could continuously call this function to drain the contract of its balance.

4. Access Control: The contract does not specify who can call the `sendToWinner` and `withdrawLeftOver` functions. Without proper access control, anyone could potentially call these functions and manipulate the outcome of the lottery.

5. Arithmetic Issues: Although not shown in the provided code snippet, if there is any arithmetic operation in the extra functionality that could lead to an integer overflow or underflow, that would be a vulnerability.

6. Time manipulation, Front-Running, Bad Randomness, and Short Address Attack vulnerabilities are not evident from the provided code snippet, but could potentially exist depending on the omitted extra functionality.

This contract needs to be revised to address these potential vulnerabilities.
