1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to Reentrancy in the 'Collect' function. It allows external calls to unknown addresses (msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) before internal state (acc.balance) is updated, which might lead to reentrancy attack.

2. Access Control: There is no proper access control in place. Any address can call 'Put', 'Collect', and 'AddMessage' functions. This could allow malicious users to interact with the contract in unintended ways.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There is a possibility for an integer underflow in the 'Collect' function when the balance gets updated (acc.balance-=_am). The contract should check whether balance is greater than or equal to _am before subtraction.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The return value of the low-level call (msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) is not checked. If the call fails, the contract will not be aware of this failure.

5. Denial of Service: There is no obvious Denial of Service vulnerability.

6. Bad Randomness: There is no usage of randomness in the contract.

7. Front-Running: There is no obvious Front-Running vulnerability.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses 'now' for time manipulation. The miner could manipulate this value potentially causing a security threat.

9. Short Address Attack: There is no obvious Short Address Attack vulnerability.

In conclusion, the contract has several vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. It needs proper access control, secure handling of external calls, checks for arithmetic operations, and a safer way to handle time-based conditions.
