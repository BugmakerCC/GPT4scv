The smart contract you provided has several vulnerabilities:

1. Bad Randomness: The "answer" variable is determined by calculating the keccak256 hash of the previous block's hash and the current timestamp. This is a bad practice since this "random" number can be predicted by miners who have control over both the block hash and the timestamp.

2. Time manipulation: As stated above, the "answer" variable relies on the current timestamp, which can be manipulated by miners.

3. Reentrancy vulnerability: Although this contract does not exhibit the classic reentrancy vulnerability (because it doesn't call an external contract), it's worth noting that the `guess()` function could potentially allow a reentrancy attack if the contract balance is greater than 2 ether. This is because it sends Ether to `msg.sender` before reducing the contract balance.

4. Denial of Service: The `guess()` function could potentially become a vector for a Denial of Service attack. If a malicious actor sets up a contract as the `msg.sender`, they could throw an exception in its fallback function, preventing the `guess()` function from successfully transferring Ether and therefore locking the contract.

5. Access Control: Although not a vulnerability per se, the contract lacks access control mechanisms. This means that any user can call any function, including `guess()`. This might be intended behavior, but it could also lead to unintended usage of the contract. 

6. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not check for overflows or underflows when handling Ether. This might not be an issue in this specific contract, but it's a good practice to always check for these problems.

The other vulnerabilities (Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls, Front-Running, and Short Address Attack) do not seem to be present in this contract.
