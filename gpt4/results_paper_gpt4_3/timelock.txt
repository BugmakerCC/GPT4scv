This smart contract appears to have a couple of vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not seem to have a reentrancy vulnerability because it follows the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. The state variable `balances[msg.sender]` is set to 0 before the external call `msg.sender.transfer(transferValue)`. However, it's good practice to use the `transfer` function because it only allows a limited amount of gas to be sent, mitigating the risk of reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have specific access control checks, meaning any address can call the `deposit()`, `increaseLockTime()`, and `withdraw()` functions. This may not be a vulnerability if the contract should be publicly accessible, but it could be problematic if only certain addresses should be able to call these functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract could suffer from an integer overflow in the `deposit()` and `increaseLockTime()` functions where the addition operation is performed. If the `balances[msg.sender]` or `lockTime[msg.sender]` is very large, adding to it could cause the value to wrap around to 0.

4. Unchecked Return Values: The contract uses the `transfer` function which throws an exception if the call fails, so it doesn't need to check return values.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not seem to have any conditions that could cause it to consume all available gas and halt, leading to a Denial of Service.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use randomness so this vulnerability is not applicable.

7. Front-Running: The contract could be vulnerable to front-running because users could inspect pending transactions and then submit their own with a higher gas price, causing them to be mined first.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract uses `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`). Miners have some ability to manipulate this value, which could potentially be used to an attacker  s advantage.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract does not seem to be vulnerable to short address attacks because it doesn't take address inputs from users. 

In summary, the main vulnerabilities to address here are Arithmetic Issues, Access Control, Time Manipulation and potential Front-Running. As always, it's recommended to use tools like Slither, Mythril or Securify to automatically detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
