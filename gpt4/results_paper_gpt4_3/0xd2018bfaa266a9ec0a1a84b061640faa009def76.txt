Following are the vulnerabilities present in the provided smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The `Get` and `withdraw` functions are vulnerable to reentrancy attack as they call the `transfer` function before updating the state of the contract. An attacker could recursively call the `Get` or `withdraw` function to drain the contract funds.

2. Access Control: The `Command` function allows the contract owner to execute arbitrary calls to any address. An attacker who becomes the owner could call any function, potentially causing damage.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);` in `Command` function is a low level call which does not check its return value. If the call fails, the contract wonâ€™t be aware of it which could lead to unexpected behavior.

4. Denial of Service: The contract can be paused indefinitely by sending more than 1 ether to the `Get` function. This function transfers all contract balance to the sender and if it fails, the function execution is stopped leading to a DoS condition.

5. Bad Randomness: There is no randomness involved, hence not applicable.

6. Front-Running: There are no transactions involving external calls based on state variables that could be front-run.

7. Time Manipulation: There is no dependency on block timestamp or related variables, hence this vulnerability is not present.

8. Short Address Attack: There is no operation involving length of the address, hence not applicable.

9. Arithmetic Issues: There is no arithmetic operation that could lead to an integer overflow or underflow.

Please note that the contract might have other logical issues, such as the `Get` function which can transfer the contract balance to any address if the value sent is more than 1 ether. This is a potential security risk and should be avoided in production contracts.
