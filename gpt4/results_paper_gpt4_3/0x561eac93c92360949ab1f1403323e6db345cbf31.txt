Upon reviewing the smart contract, three vulnerabilities are discovered:

1. Reentrancy: In the `Collect` function, the contract sends Ether (msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) before updating the internal state (balances[msg.sender]-=_am). This could lead to a reentrancy attack where the recipient of the Ether could re-enter the `Collect` function before the internal state has been updated, potentially enabling them to drain more Ether than they should be able to.

2. Access Control: There are no access controls to limit who can call the `SetMinSum` and `SetLogFile` functions. This could allow any address to change these critical variables. Also, these functions can be called multiple times before the contract is initialized, leading to potential exploits.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The return value of the `call.value` function is not checked. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

Recommendations for fixing these vulnerabilities include:

- For the reentrancy vulnerability, update the internal state before sending Ether.
- Implement proper access controls for setting critical variables.
- Check the return value of `call.value` to ensure it is performed successfully.
