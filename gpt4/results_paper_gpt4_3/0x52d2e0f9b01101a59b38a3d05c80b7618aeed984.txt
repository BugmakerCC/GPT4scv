After reviewing the given smart contract, I have identified a few potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `withdrawEther()` is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The contract sends ether with `owner.transfer(this.balance);` without ensuring the state of the contract is updated beforehand. If the owner is a contract, it could call the function again before the state (balance) has been updated.

2. Access Control: There are no restrictions or access controls on who can call the `withdrawTokens(address tokenContract)` and `withdrawEther()` functions. Any address can withdraw all the tokens or ether from the contract.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: In function `getTokens(uint num, address addr)`, a low level call `addr.call.value(0 wei)();` is used without checking the return value, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

4. Denial of Service: The function `getTokens(uint num, address addr)` can lead to denial of service. It loops `num` times and if `num` is very large, it can consume all the gas provided, leading to an out-of-gas exception.

5. Bad Randomness: Not applicable, as there is no randomness involved in this contract.

6. Front-Running: Not applicable, there seems to be no front-running vulnerability in this contract.

7. Time manipulation: Not applicable, as there is no dependency on block.timestamp or now keyword.

8. Short Address Attack: Not applicable, as there are no external calls that send more than 2300 gas or transfer control flow.

To mitigate these issues, consider implementing access controls or modifiers to restrict who can call certain functions, use `transfer()` instead of `call.value()()` for sending ether, and always check the return value of external calls. Also, avoid loops that could consume a lot of gas and ensure state variables are updated before transferring any value.
