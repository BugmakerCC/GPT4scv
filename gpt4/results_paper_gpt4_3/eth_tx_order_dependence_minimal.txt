The smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is susceptible to a reentrancy attack in the setReward() function. Here, the owner.transfer(reward) function is called before the reward is set to msg.value. This could allow the owner to reenter the function before the reward is changed, potentially draining the contract of Ether.

2. Access Control: The contract does not properly implement access control. While it does check if msg.sender == owner in the setReward() function, it does not do so in the claimReward() function. This allows anyone to claim the reward, not just the owner.

3. Denial of Service: If the contract's balance is less than the reward, the contract could be locked in the claimReward() function because it requires the contract to have enough balance to transfer the reward to msg.sender.

4. Front-Running: This contract does not mitigate front-running attacks. An attacker can watch the mempool for pending transactions and then submit a transaction with a higher gas fee to claim the reward before the original transaction gets mined.

5. Time manipulation and Bad Randomness vulnerabilities are not present as there are no dependencies on block timestamps or random number generation.

6. Arithmetic Issues, Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls and Short Address Attack vulnerabilities also not present in this contract. 

Please note that these vulnerabilities can be mitigated by implementing proper access controls, using a withdrawal pattern for Ether transfers, and using an oracle or commit-reveal scheme to prevent front-running.
