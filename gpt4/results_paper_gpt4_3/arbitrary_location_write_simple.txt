The given smart contract has a few vulnerabilities:

1. Arithmetic Issues (Integer Underflow): The `PopBonusCode` function can cause an underflow. If `bonusCodes.length` is 0, it will underflow to a very large number when `bonusCodes.length--` is executed.

2. Access Control: The `PushBonusCode`, `PopBonusCode`, `UpdateBonusCodeAt` and `Destroy` functions are public, which means any address can call them. Ideally, only the owner should be able to call these functions.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: There is a low level call (`selfdestruct`) in the `Destroy` function. The return value of this call is not checked. Even though `selfdestruct` does not actually return a value, it's a good practice to handle low level calls carefully.

4. Denial of Service: If an attacker is the owner, they can call the `Destroy` function to kill the contract, causing a denial of service for other users.

5. Time manipulation: There is no vulnerability related to this in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: There is no vulnerability related to this in the contract.

7. Front-Running: There is no vulnerability related to this in the contract.

8. Reentrancy: There is no vulnerability related to this in the contract.

9. Short Address Attack: There is no vulnerability related to this in the contract.
