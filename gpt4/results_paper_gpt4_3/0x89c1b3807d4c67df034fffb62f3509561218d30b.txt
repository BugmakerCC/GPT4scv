The smart contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract has the reentrancy vulnerability. In the `request` function, the contract calls the external contract `msg.sender` before changing its state. This can allow an attacker to perform a reentrancy attack, draining the contract of its funds.

2. Access Control: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms. For instance, the `upgrade`, `reset`, `suspend`, `restart`, and `withdraw` functions are only meant to be called by the contract owner, but the contract does not define an owner.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic issues such as integer overflow or underflow in this contract.

4. Unchecked Return Values: The contract does not check the return value of `SGX_ADDRESS.send(CANCELLATION_FEE);` in the `deliver` function and `msg.sender.call.value(fee - CANCELLATION_FEE)()` in the `cancel` function. If these calls fail, the contract state may become inconsistent.

5. Denial of Service: The contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. If an attacker floods the contract with requests, the `request` function may run out of gas, preventing legitimate users from interacting with the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness, so this vulnerability does not apply.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not involve any transactions that can be front-run, so this vulnerability does not apply.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps or block numbers for critical functionalities, so this vulnerability does not apply.

9. Short Address Attack: There is no vulnerability to a short address attack in this contract as it does not take address inputs from users. 

Please note that this is a preliminary analysis and a proper audit should be conducted by a professional auditor to ensure the contract's security.
