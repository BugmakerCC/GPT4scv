The provided smart contract has a potential vulnerability related to Reentrancy.

In the `withdrawFunds` function, the `require(msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)());` line sends Ether to an external address. If this address is a contract, it could potentially make a call back to `withdrawFunds` before `balances[msg.sender] -= _weiToWithdraw;` and `lastWithdrawTime[msg.sender] = now;` have a chance to execute. This can result in the attacker draining more Ether than they should be able to.

To mitigate this reentrancy vulnerability, the state changes should be made before calling external contracts, like so:

```sol
balances[msg.sender] -= _weiToWithdraw;
lastWithdrawTime[msg.sender] = now;
require(msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)());
```

Additionally, it's safer to use the `transfer` method instead of `call.value()()`, since `transfer` automatically throws on failure and has a gas limit that prevents reentrancy.

There also could be a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability with unexpected throw. If the `require(msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)());` fails for some reason, it will prevent the user from ever withdrawing their funds.

Other vulnerabilities like Access Control, Arithmetic Issues, Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, and Short Address Attack are not present in this contract. However, it's always good practice to keep them in mind when building smart contracts.
