This contract contains the `Access Control` vulnerability. The `sudicideAnyone` function allows any caller to destroy the contract using the `selfdestruct` function. This function sends all remaining Ether stored in the contract to the `msg.sender` address, which can be anyone who calls the function. 

There is no access control mechanism in place to restrict who can call this function. Typically, such a function should only be callable by the contract owner or other trusted addresses, and not by arbitrary addresses. 

This vulnerability could be fixed by adding a modifier to check that `msg.sender` is the contract owner before allowing the function to execute. 

For example:

```
contract SimpleSuicide {
  address private owner;

  function SimpleSuicide() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function sudicideAnyone() public {
    require(msg.sender == owner);
    selfdestruct(owner);
  }

}
```
In this updated contract, the `SimpleSuicide` constructor sets the `owner` variable to the address that deployed the contract. The `sudicideAnyone` function then checks that `msg.sender` is the `owner` before proceeding with the `selfdestruct` call.
