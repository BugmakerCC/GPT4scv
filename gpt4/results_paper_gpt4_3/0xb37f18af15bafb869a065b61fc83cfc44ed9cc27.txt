This smart contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdraw` and `sendMoney` functions are susceptible to a reentrancy attack. These functions send ether with `transfer` and `call.value`, respectively, which can allow for external contract calls. An attacker could create a malicious contract that, when called, reenters the `withdraw` or `sendMoney` function to drain more funds than intended.

2. Access Control: The contract seems to correctly use the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access to certain functions. However, there's no function allowing the owner to be changed, which may or may not be intended.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `sendMoney` function uses a low-level `call` without checking its return value. If the call fails for any reason, the contract won't know and won't revert the transaction.

4. Denial of Service: An attacker could potentially force the contract to go out of gas. If the attacker sends ether to the contract without enough gas, the fallback function increases the `depositsCount` variable. If this happens repeatedly, the contract might reach the gas limit and become unusable.

5. Bad Randomness: Does not seem to apply as there is no randomness in the contract.

6. Front-Running: Does not seem to apply as there are no transactions that depend on the order of execution.

7. Time manipulation: Does not seem to apply as there are no time-dependent functions.

8. Short Address Attack: Does not seem to apply as all address inputs are in the form of function parameters, not through msg.data. 

A thorough review and testing should be done to ensure the security of the contract.
