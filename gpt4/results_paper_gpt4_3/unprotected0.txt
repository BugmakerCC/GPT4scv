The vulnerability in this contract is related to Access Control. The function `changeOwner` is not protected by the `onlyowner` modifier, meaning that anyone can call this function and change the owner of the contract. This would allow an attacker to take full control of the contract.

The commented function `changeOwner_fixed` shows how this issue can be fixed, by applying the `onlyowner` modifier to the function to ensure that only the current owner of the contract can change the ownership. 

The contract does not appear to have reentrancy, arithmetic issues, unchecked return values for low level calls, denial of service, bad randomness, front-running, time manipulation, or short address attack vulnerabilities. However, it's important to note that the presence of one vulnerability might hide others, and this analysis is based on the provided code snippet only.
