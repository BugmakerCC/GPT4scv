The given smart contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `go()` is vulnerable to Reentrancy. It first sends ether to `target` and then to `owner`. If the `target` is a malicious contract, it could call back into `go()`, allowing it to extract all ether from this contract.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The low level `.call()` function is used without checking its return value. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

3. Access Control: There is no access control on the `go()` function. Anybody can call this function and transfer all funds to the `owner`.

4. Denial of Service: If the `target` becomes a contract that always throws, the `owner` will never be able to withdraw their funds because the `target.call.value(msg.value)()` will always fail.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern or a reentrancy guard.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: Always check the return value of `.call()`.

3. Access Control: Add a modifier to the `go()` function to allow only the owner to call it.

4. Denial of Service: Instead of transferring all funds to the owner in the same function where you interact with an arbitrary contract, consider allowing the owner to withdraw their funds in a separate function.

This contract doesn't seem to have issues related to Arithmetic Issues, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time Manipulation, and Short Address Attack. However, each smart contract is unique and may contain other vulnerabilities not included in this list, so it's always a good idea to get a professional audit if you're not 100% sure.
