The given smart contract has at least two potential vulnerabilities:

1. Access Control: The `forward` function is not protected with any access control mechanism. This means that anyone can call this function, thereby potentially leading to unauthorized actions.

2. Reentrancy: The contract is also at risk of a Reentrancy attack because it uses a low-level call (`delegatecall`). An attacker could create a malicious contract that, when called by the `forward` function, calls back into the `forward` function before the first call is finished. This could lead to unexpected behavior or even a loop that consumes all the gas.

To fix the Access Control vulnerability, you could add a modifier that ensures only the owner of the contract can call the `forward` function:

```
modifier onlyOwner {
    require(msg.sender == owner);
    _;
}

function forward(address callee, bytes _data) public onlyOwner {
...
}
```

To mitigate the Reentrancy attack, you could use a mutex or reentrancy guard that prevents the same function from being re-entered while it's still being executed:

```
bool private locked = false;

modifier noReentrancy {
    require(!locked);
    locked = true;
    _;
    locked = false;
}

function forward(address callee, bytes _data) public onlyOwner noReentrancy {
...
}
```
