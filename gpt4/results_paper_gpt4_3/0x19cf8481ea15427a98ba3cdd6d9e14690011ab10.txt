From a quick review of the smart contract, here are potential vulnerabilities and issues:

1. Reentrancy: There are no evident reentrancy vulnerabilities in the contract as all the external calls are at the end of the functions. However, the contract lacks the use of reentrancy guard which could prevent reentrancy attacks.

2. Arithmetic Issues: The contract uses SafeMath for arithmetic operations which helps to prevent integer overflow and underflow issues.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses `.transfer` method for sending ether, which automatically throws on failure. However, the contract also uses the `send` method in `PartialFundsTransfer` and `FundsTransfer` functions which can potentially fail silently. The return value needs to be checked.

4. Access Control: The contract seems to use access control by checking whether the sender is the owner for certain functions. However, it only has one role (owner) and lacks a more robust access control mechanism.

5. Denial of Service: The contract doesn't seem to have protection against DoS attacks. The refund function can potentially be blocked if a lot of users call it simultaneously.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness, so this vulnerability is not present.

7. Front-Running: The contract may be vulnerable to front-running attacks as it doesn't take measures to prevent them, such as using a commit-reveal scheme.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses `block.number` for time reference, which is more reliable than `block.timestamp`. However, it doesn't take into account that block time can vary.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract doesn't seem to have protection against the short address attack. It could be mitigated by adding a condition to check the size of the input data in the functions that call `transfer`.

10. Other issues: The contract has multiple functions that have the potential to lock up funds (e.g., `finalize`), and it lacks a function to update the owner.

Please note that this analysis does not guarantee the contract is secure and further in-depth analysis and testing are required.
