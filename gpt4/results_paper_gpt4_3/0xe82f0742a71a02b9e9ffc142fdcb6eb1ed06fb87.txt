The contract seems to have multiple vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability appears in the GetFreebie() function where the contract makes an external call to msg.sender.transfer(this.balance). An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls GetFreebie() and in the fallback function again calls GetFreebie(), this will drain all the ether from the contract. It is always recommended to use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to avoid these kind of attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract seems to have a hardcoded address 0x30ad12df80a2493a82DdFE367d866616db8a2595 that can become the owner and withdraw all the funds. This hardcoded address seems to be a backdoor.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There doesn't seem to be an arithmetic issue in this contract.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract has a low level call in the Command function. It does not check the return value of this call, this can lead to silent fails.

5. Denial of Service: The contract seems to be susceptible to a denial of service attack. If the contract's balance is below 1 ether, the GetFreebie function will be stuck because it tries to transfer the entire balance of the contract to the msg.sender.

6. Bad Randomness: This contract does not use any randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to front-running.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps or block numbers so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to short address attack as it does not take address as an input from users. However, it's always a good practice to use transferFrom and approve instead of direct transfers. 

Please note that these are potential vulnerabilities and the impact and exploitability may vary depending on the usage of this contract. Always consult with a professional auditor for thorough contract audits.
