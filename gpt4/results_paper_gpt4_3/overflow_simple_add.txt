Analyzing the provided smart contract, it is evident that the contract has an Arithmetic Issue related to integer overflow. Here's how:

The contract has a function `add` which increases the contract's `balance` by a `deposit` amount. However, there is no check to ensure that this addition does not result in an overflow. 

In solidity, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either less than the minimum or more than the maximum permissible value. 

If an attacker provides a sufficiently large value of `deposit`, the `balance` can overflow and be reset to a low value. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow an attacker to drain the contract's funds.

Fixed contract could look like this:
```solidity
pragma solidity 0.4.25;

contract Overflow_Add {
    uint public balance = 1;

    function add(uint256 deposit) public {
        require(balance + deposit >= balance, "Addition overflow");
        balance += deposit;
    }
}
```
This contract uses the `require` function to ensure that the balance does not overflow when the deposit is added. If the condition inside the `require` function is not met, the transaction is reverted and no changes are made. This prevents integer overflow vulnerability. 

As for the other vulnerabilities mentioned, this contract doesn't appear to be susceptible. It doesn't contain any external calls or send commands that could lead to reentrancy, it doesn't depend on external input for array access or looping, it doesn't make use of randomness, and it doesn't depend on timestamps or block information. It also doesn't have any external facing functions that require specific access controls.
