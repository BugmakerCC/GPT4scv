This smart contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This contract seems to be vulnerable to Reentrancy attack because it directly calls an external contract `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v);` within a for loop. An attacker could make the external contract's `transferFrom` function re-enter the `transfer` function in this contract.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses `call()` function to call an external function but does not check the return value of the call. If `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v);` fails, the contract would continue executing and return `true`. This could lead to unexpected and incorrect execution.

3. Denial of Service: If any of the addresses in `_tos` array is a contract that throws an exception or consumes a lot of gas, it could lead to Denial of Service for the entire `transfer` function. 

4. Access Control: There is no access control in the contract. The `transfer` function can be called by anyone, making it possible for malicious actors to manipulate the contract.

The code should be improved with the use of safer `transferFrom` from ERC20, proper return value checks, reentrancy guard, and access controls. It's also recommended to avoid loops for transactions to prevent potential DoS attacks.
