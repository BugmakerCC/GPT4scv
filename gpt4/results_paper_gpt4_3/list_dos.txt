After analyzing the provided smart contract, I found the following potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The smart contract uses the `send` method to transfer funds, which can lead to a reentrancy attack. This is because `send` does not throw an exception when the call fails but returns false.

2. Arithmetic Issues: The contract contains several arithmetic operations such as `amount * 110 / 100` and `amount * 5/100` that could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow, although these specific instances are not likely to cause such issues due to the nature of the values involved.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The return values of `send` are not checked, which could cause silent failing sends. If the `send` function fails for any reason, the contract will not be aware of this and will continue executing.

4. Denial of Service: A potential denial of service attack could be achieved by an attacker forcing the contract to enter into the `if (lastTimeOfNewCredit + TWELVE_HOURS < block.timestamp)` condition, which resets the state of the contract and could potentially lock funds.

5. Access Control: Functions like `inheritToNextGeneration` are only protected by a simple condition check (`if (msg.sender == corruptElite)`). If the private key of the `corruptElite` were compromised, the entire contract could be taken over.

6. Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, and Short Address Attack vulnerabilities do not appear to be present in this contract.

It's important to note that this analysis is based on the given code and there might be additional vulnerabilities not covered by the list provided or not visible without a more thorough security audit. Furthermore, this analysis doesn't cover potential logical errors or bad practices in the code that might not be direct security vulnerabilities but could still lead to undesired behavior.
