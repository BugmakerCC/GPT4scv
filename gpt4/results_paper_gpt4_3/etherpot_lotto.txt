This contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `cash` function sends Ether to a user-controlled address `winner.send(subpot);` and then modifies the state `rounds[roundIndex].isCashed[subpotIndex] = true;`. This is a reentrancy attack vector where the recipient contract could call back into `cash` before the first call has a chance to finish.

2. Bad Randomness: The `calculateWinner` function uses `block.blockhash` for randomness. This is insecure because miners can manipulate the block hash to a certain extent.

3. Access Control: There is no check for who can call the `cash` function. Anybody can call it and potentially send the winnings to the winner even before the winner has a chance to claim it.

4. Arithmetic Issues: While not directly present, there's no use of SafeMath library which could lead to potential overflow or underflow issues.

5. Denial of Service: The `cash` function could fail if the `winner` address is a contract with a fallback function that consumes a lot of gas. This would block others from being able to call the `cash` function.

6. Front-Running: Since Ethereum transactions are public, an attacker could see a transaction calling the `cash` function and quickly submit another transaction with a higher gas price to claim the reward first.

7. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: While `send` is used to transfer funds, its return value is not checked which could lead to silent failures.

8. Short Address Attack and Time manipulation vulnerabilities do not seem to be present in the code.
