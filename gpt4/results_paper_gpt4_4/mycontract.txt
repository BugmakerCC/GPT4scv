This smart contract contains at least two potential vulnerabilities:

1. **Access Control**: The contract uses `tx.origin` for authentication, which is a security risk. `tx.origin` is the original sender of the transaction, while `msg.sender` is the direct sender of the call. If a malicious contract is called by the owner, `tx.origin` would still be the owner, allowing the malicious contract to bypass the access control. It is recommended to use `msg.sender` for authentication instead of `tx.origin`.

2. **Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls**: The contract uses `transfer()` function to send Ether. However, it does not check the return value of the `transfer()` function. This function returns `false` when the transfer fails. Ignoring the return value of `transfer()` could lead to unexpected behavior of the contract if the transfer fails.

In addition, the `MyContract()` function should be defined as a constructor. In Solidity 0.4.24, the constructor is defined using the contract name, but this has been deprecated in newer versions in favor of the `constructor()` keyword. 

The contract does not seem to have other vulnerabilities listed above. However, without knowing the exact use case of the contract, it is hard to guarantee that it is free from other potential vulnerabilities.
