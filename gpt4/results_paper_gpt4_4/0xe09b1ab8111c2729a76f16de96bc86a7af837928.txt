This contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy as there are no nested calls to external contracts.

2. Access Control: The contract uses the `onlyOwner` and `onlyBot` modifiers to restrict access to certain functions. However, it doesn't check if the `owner`, `autoPlayBot` and `secretSigner` addresses are not zero when setting.

3. Arithmetic Issues (integer overflow and underflow): There are no checks to prevent integer overflow or underflow. However, it seems unlikely that overflow or underflow could occur given the values involved.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not check the return value of the transfer function in payout, sendRefund, and sendFunds methods, which could fail silently. It's a potential security risk. It is safer to use `transfer` instead of `send`.

5. Denial of Service: If a player address is a contract that always throws an error when receiving Ether (fallback function), it can potentially block the `payout` and `sendRefund` functions.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses `blockhash(blockNumber)` for randomness which can be predicted to some extent by miners.

7. Front-Running: The contract is vulnerable to front-running as miners can manipulate the order of transactions.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses `block.number` to check bet expiration which can be manipulated by miners to a certain extent.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not appear to be vulnerable to the short address attack as the length of the address is not directly used in the contract. However, always verifying the length of the address would be a good practice.

10. The `kill` function can be exploited by the owner to withdraw all the funds when there are no ongoing bets, which might not be the intended behavior.

11. The `clearStorage` function can be potentially abused by the contract owner to clear bets before they are settled.

12. The `transferAnyERC20Token` function allows the contract owner to withdraw any ERC20 tokens sent to the contract. This could be misused if not carefully monitored.

It's recommended to address these issues to ensure the security and reliability of the contract.
