The smart contract provided has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Access Control: The `register` function has a `require(unlocked)` condition at the end of the function, which means that the statements above it will get executed even if the contract is locked. The `require(unlocked)` should be at the beginning of the function to ensure that it only executes when the contract is unlocked. This is a potential Access Control vulnerability.

2. Uninitialized Storage: The `NameRecord newRecord;` is an uninitialized storage pointer. This will point to storage slot 0 by default and could potentially overwrite other variables. This is a serious vulnerability and it should be changed to `NameRecord memory newRecord;` to make it a memory variable instead.

Apart from these, the contract does not seem to have the other vulnerabilities mentioned. For example, there are no external calls that can lead to reentrancy, no arithmetic operations that can cause under or overflow, no low level calls with unchecked return values, no potentially long running loops that can cause gas limit issues or denial of service, no uses of `blockhash`, `block.timestamp` or `block.number` that can lead to bad randomness, no transaction ordering or time dependencies that can lead to front-running or time manipulation and no address manipulation that can lead to short address attacks.
