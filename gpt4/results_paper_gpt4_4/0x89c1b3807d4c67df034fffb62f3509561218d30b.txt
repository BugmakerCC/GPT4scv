The smart contract provided has a number of vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract has multiple `call.value()` placed in the contract, which is a potential for reentrancy attacks. In the `withdraw()` function, `if (!requests[0].requester.call.value(this.balance)())`, if the caller is a contract, it can call `withdraw()` again before the first call finishes, resulting in more Ether being withdrawn than should be possible. The same issue can be observed in the `request()` and `cancel()` functions.

2. Access Control: The smart contract does not implement any access controls for critical functions such as `upgrade()`, `reset()`, `suspend()`, `restart()`, and `withdraw()`. Any user can call these functions, which can lead to unauthorized contract behavior.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not use SafeMath library for arithmetic operations. This leaves the contract vulnerable to underflow and overflow attacks.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: Low-level calls are used in the contract without checking their return values. This can lead to unexpected contract behavior.

5. Denial of Service: If an attacker manages to keep the `requestCnt` always increasing by continuously calling the `request()` function, it might cause a Denial of Service because the `deliver()` function will not be able to find the correct `requestId` to respond to.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable since there is no randomness in this contract.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable since there is no transaction ordering dependency in this contract.

8. Time manipulation: Not applicable since there is no timestamp dependency in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable as there are no off-chain issues or client vulnerabilities in this contract. 

Recommendations to fix these vulnerabilities would be to use reentrancy guards, implement access controls, use SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, check the return value of low-level calls, avoid using `call.value()` and manage state variables to prevent a Denial of Service attack.
