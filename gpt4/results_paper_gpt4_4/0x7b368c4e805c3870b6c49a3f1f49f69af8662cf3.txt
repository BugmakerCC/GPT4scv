The given smart contract has three main vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy vulnerability: The function `Collect(uint _am)` is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. This function sends ether to the `msg.sender` address before updating the balance of the `msg.sender` address in the `Acc` mapping. An attacker can recursively call this function before the balance is updated, draining more funds than they should have access to.

2. Timestamp Dependence (block.timestamp): The smart contract uses `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) for log time and unlock time. Miners can manipulate this value to some degree which can lead to unpredictable behavior.

3. Unchecked Low Level Calls: In the function `Collect(uint _am)`, the return value of the `call.value(_am)()` function isn't checked. If this call fails due to the contract at the recipient address throwing an exception or the call running out of gas, the `acc.balance-=_am;` operation would still execute, leading to inconsistency in the contract's state.

To fix these issues:

1. For the reentrancy attack, you could use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern where you perform any external calls last, after all internal work is done.

2. For the timestamp dependence, avoid using `block.timestamp` for critical logic. If necessary, consider using block number instead, which is harder to manipulate.

3. For unchecked low-level calls, always handle the potential failure of `call`. You could use the `transfer` function for sending Ether, which throws on failure, preventing state changes.
