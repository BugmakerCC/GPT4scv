This contract has a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to the gas limit. The functions `insertNnumbers()`, `clear()` and `clearDOS()` can be exploited to make the contract unusable.

In the `insertNnumbers()` function, the for loop will consume gas for each iteration. If the 'numbers' input is sufficiently large, the function could consume all the gas provided in a transaction, causing the function to fail. 

Similarly, in the `clear()` and `clearDOS()` functions, the `require(numElements>1500)` statement could potentially cause a DoS attack. If the 'numElements' variable is less than or equal to 1500, the function will always fail and throw an exception, making it impossible to clear the array.

Also, the `clearDOS()` function attempts to deallocate the whole array at once which can be a potential vulnerability if the array size is large, because it could exceed the block gas limit, causing the transaction to invariably fail. 

It is advised to delete elements in a loop, with a check to prevent gas limit issues. 

There are no signs of Reentrancy, Access Control, Arithmetic Issues, Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation or Short Address Attack vulnerabilities in this contract.
