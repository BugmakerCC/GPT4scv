The smart contract provided has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdraw` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The state of the contract (`Deposits[msg.sender]`) is updated after the transfer function (`msg.sender.transfer(amount);`) This allows a malicious contract to repeatedly call the `withdraw` function and drain the contract of its funds.

2. Access Control: This contract has a serious access control issue. The `onlyOwner` modifier checks if `msg.sender` is equal to `Owner`, but both the `Proxy` and `DepositProxy` contracts have an `Owner` state variable. It's unclear which one is actually being checked. This could lead to unexpected behavior and potentially unauthorized access.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There is no protection against underflow in `Deposits[msg.sender] -= amount;` If `amount > Deposits[msg.sender]`, this will underflow and the user's balance will be very large.

4. Unchecked Return Values: The `target.call.value(msg.value)(data);` low-level call in `proxy` function does not check the return value. If the call fails for any reason, the contract will not be aware and continue execution.

5. Denial of Service (DoS): If an attacker is able to become the owner of the contract, they could refuse to process transactions, effectively performing a DoS attack.

6. Time Manipulation: There's no obvious time manipulation vulnerability in this contract.

7. Bad Randomness: There's no obvious bad randomness vulnerability in this contract.

8. Front-Running: There's no obvious front-running vulnerability in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: There's no obvious short address attack vulnerability in this contract. 

Please note that the presence of these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to drain funds from the contract or otherwise manipulate its state. The contract should be rewritten with these vulnerabilities in mind to ensure it is secure.
