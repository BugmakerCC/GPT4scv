The given smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function GetPie() is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. It first sends ether to the owner and then to the message sender. An attacker can make a recursive call to drain the contract's funds.

2. Access Control: The contract allows the owner to change at any time by calling the withdraw() function. This can lead to unauthorized changes in the contract's ownership.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: In the Command() function, the return value of the low-level call is not checked. If the call fails, the contract will not be aware of it.

4. Denial of Service: The GetPie() function can be exploited to perform a Denial of Service attack. If an attacker sends more than 1 ether, they can drain all the contract's funds.

5. Bad Randomness: Not applicable here as the contract does not use any randomness.

6. Front-Running: Not applicable here as the contract does not use any function that depends on the order of transactions.

7. Time manipulation: Not applicable here as the contract does not use any timestamp or blocktime.

8. Short Address Attack: Not applicable here as there is no off-chain interaction.

It's recommended to use the withdrawal pattern instead of direct transfer to avoid reentrancy attacks, check the return value of low-level calls, and use modifiers to limit access to certain functions.
