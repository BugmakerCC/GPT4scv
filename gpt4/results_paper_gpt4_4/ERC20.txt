The smart contract provided does not seem to have any of the nine common vulnerabilities listed. 

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not make any external calls in the middle of its functions, so there is no risk of reentrancy attacks.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any privileged functions that are not properly protected by access control.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract uses the SafeMath library for all its arithmetic operations, which provides overflow and underflow protection.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not make any low level calls.

5. Denial of Service: There is no risk of DoS attacks as there are no loops in the contract that an attacker could manipulate to consume all the gas.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any form of randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not have any transaction ordering dependence issues.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps or block numbers.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not take any inputs with lengths controlled by the user, so there is no risk of a short address attack.

However, note that this contract is a basic ERC20 token contract, and it does not implement the totalSupply() function, which is part of the ERC20 standard. Additionally, the constructor does not set the _totalSupply variable. These are not vulnerabilities, but they are deviations from the standard.
