Analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the vulnerabilities associated with the common categories:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not have any reentrancy vulnerabilities as it does not make any external calls in the middle of a function.

2. Access Control: The contract implements an access control mechanism where only the owners of the contract can execute certain functions. However, there is no check in the fallback function to prevent non-owners from calling the wallet library. This is a serious vulnerability.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There is no use of SafeMath library or checks for overflows/underflows when performing arithmetic operations. This could potentially lead to arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses low-level calls like `delegatecall` but does not check their return values which can lead to unchecked call return values vulnerability.

5. Denial of Service: There does not seem to be any obvious denial of service vulnerabilities in the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness, so there's no bad randomness vulnerability.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not involve any transactions that could be susceptible to front-running.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) to calculate the current day. This could potentially be manipulated by miners, but the impact would be minimal in this case.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not explicitly protect against a short address attack. However, this attack is usually more relevant to the frontend interfaces interacting with the contract, rather than the contract itself.

In conclusion, the major vulnerabilities in this contract are access control and unchecked return values for low-level calls, and possibly arithmetic issues.
