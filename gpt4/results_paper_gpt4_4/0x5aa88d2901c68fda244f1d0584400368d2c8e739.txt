1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attack in the "multiplicate" function. The contract sends ether with "adr.transfer" before updating its own balance, an attacker could create a fallback function to call "multiplicate" again before the first call is finished.

2. Access Control: The contract seems to properly check that only the owner can call "withdraw" and "Command" functions.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There is a potential integer overflow issue in the "multiplicate" function when it calculates "this.balance + msg.value". If the sum exceeds the maximum value that can be held by the variable, it will wrap around to a very small number.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The "adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)" in "Command" function is a low level call and its return value is not checked.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not seem to have any denial of service vulnerabilities.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not rely on any randomness so there is no bad randomness vulnerability.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not seem to have any front-running vulnerabilities.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on any time or block variables so there is no time manipulation vulnerability.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to have any short address attack vulnerabilities. 

Please note that this analysis does not guarantee the contract is free from any other vulnerabilities not listed above. Always perform a thorough audit when dealing with smart contracts.
