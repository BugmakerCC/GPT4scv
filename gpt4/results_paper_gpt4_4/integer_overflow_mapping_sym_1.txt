This contract has an Arithmetic Issue vulnerability, specifically an Integer Underflow. 

The function `init` subtracts the value `v` from the value at map index `k`. If the value `v` is greater than the current value at map index `k`, this will result in an integer underflow. 

An Integer Underflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is below the minimum value in the range of values that can be represented within a given number of bits. In such cases, the value wraps around to the maximum number that can be represented. 

This can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the values in the `map` mapping. 

It's recommended to use SafeMath or similar libraries to avoid this kind of vulnerability. Here is an example of how to prevent the underflow:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.11;

import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";

contract IntegerOverflowMappingSym1 {
    using SafeMath for uint256;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) map;

    function init(uint256 k, uint256 v) public {
        require(map[k] >= v, "Underflow detected");
        map[k] = map[k].sub(v);
    }
}
```
This modified version of the contract uses SafeMath for subtraction, which will revert the transaction if an underflow is about to happen, thereby preventing it.
