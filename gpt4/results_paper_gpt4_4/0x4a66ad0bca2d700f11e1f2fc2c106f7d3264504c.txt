This smart contract seems to be vulnerable to the following vulnerabilities:

1. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses the low-level .call() method without checking its return value. If the called contract throws an exception or runs out of gas, call() will return false but the current contract will still continue execution. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

2. Access Control: The function transfer() can only be called by the address 0x9797055B68C5DadDE6b3c7d5D80C9CFE2eecE6c9. This is an access control vulnerability as if the private key of this address gets compromised, the attacker would be able to transfer the contract's funds to any address they want.

3. Denial of Service: The transfer() function could potentially run out of gas if the _tos array is too large, causing a denial of service.

4. Arithmetic Issues: The multiplication v[i]*1000000000000000000 could potentially overflow, however, it's unlikely due to the large number required for overflow.

The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to Reentrancy, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, or Short Address Attack. However, without seeing the entire codebase and understanding the full context, it's difficult to definitively state whether these vulnerabilities are indeed not present.
