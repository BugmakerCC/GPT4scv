The given smart contract shows a number of vulnerabilities from the list:

1. **Reentrancy**: The `Collect` function has a reentrancy vulnerability. It uses a `call.value()` function which can allow the caller to re-enter the contract before the state (in this case `acc.balance`) has been updated.

2. **Access Control**: There is no access control for the functions `SetMinSum`, `SetLogFile`, and `Initialized`. Anyone can call these functions and change the state of the contract. 

3. **Arithmetic Issues**: There is a potential for an integer underflow in the `Collect` function, where `_am` is subtracted from `acc.balance`. If `_am` is larger than `acc.balance`, this will result in a large number due to underflow.

4. **Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls**: The return value of `call.value()` in the `Collect` function is not checked.

5. **Denial of Service**: An attacker might be able to keep the contract busy by continuously calling the `Put` function, which could potentially reach the gas limit.

6. **Bad Randomness**: This contract does not seem to use any randomness.

7. **Front-Running**: This contract does not seem to have any front-running issues.

8. **Time manipulation**: The `Put` function uses the `now` keyword, which can potentially be manipulated by miners.

9. **Short Address Attack**: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to short address attacks, as it does not take address input from users. However, this vulnerability may still exist in a larger system where this contract interacts with other contracts or off-chain systems. 

It's advised to address these vulnerabilities before deploying this contract.
