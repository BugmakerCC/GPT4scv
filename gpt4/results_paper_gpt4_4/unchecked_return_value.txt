The smart contract you provided is vulnerable to the 'Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls' vulnerability. 

In the function "callnotchecked", the contract is calling an external address without checking the return value of the call. This is a security vulnerability because the callee contract could fail, and this contract would not be aware of it because it does not check the return value of the call. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the contract.

The function "callchecked" mitigates this vulnerability by using the "require" function to ensure that the callee.call() operation was successful.

To fix the vulnerability in the "callnotchecked" function, you should check the return value of the call, like this:

```solidity
function callnotchecked(address callee) public {
    require(callee.call(), "External call failed");
}
```

I can't find evidence of the other vulnerabilities you listed in this contract. However, please note that just because a contract doesn't have a certain vulnerability doesn't mean it's safe. A contract also needs to have a certain function to be exploitable. For example, this contract doesn't have any integers, so it can't have an integer overflow or underflow. Similarly, it doesn't manage any funds, so it can't have a reentrancy vulnerability.
