The smart contract provided has a few vulnerability issues:

1. Reentrancy: This vulnerability is present in this contract. The contract calls an external contract (`caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v)`) in a loop, which can lead to a reentrancy attack if the called contract has malicious code.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place. This means that any address can call the `transfer` function. This can lead to unauthorized actions being performed.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The return value of the `call` function is not being checked. If the `call` fails for any reason, the contract will not be able to detect it. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

4. Denial of Service: As the contract calls external contracts in a loop, a malicious contract can cause the `transfer` function to run out of gas, effectively causing a Denial of Service attack.

5. Front-Running: This contract is potentially vulnerable to front-running attacks where a malicious actor can see the pending transactions and manipulate the order of transactions.

6. Time Manipulation: This contract doesn't seem to rely on timestamps or block numbers, so it is not vulnerable to this type of attack.

7. Short Address Attack: This contract does not seem to have this vulnerability as it does not manipulate or depend on the length of addresses.

8. Arithmetic Issues and Bad Randomness are not applicable as the contract does not perform any arithmetic operations or generate any random numbers. 

To remediate these issues, the contract should implement access controls, check the return value of the `call` function, avoid calling external contracts in a loop or implement reentrancy guards, and consider other means of performing transfers that are not susceptible to front-running.
