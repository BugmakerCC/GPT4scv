The smart contract you provided has the "Arithmetic Issues" vulnerability, also known as integer overflow and underflow. 

1. Integer Overflow: In the functions `overflowaddtostate(uint256 input)` and `overflowmultostate(uint256 input)`, if the `input` value is large enough, it can cause the `count` variable to overflow. Since there is no check against this, the `count` value will roll over to a very small number, which might not be the expected behavior.

2. Integer Underflow: Similarly, in the function `underflowtostate(uint256 input)`, if the `input` value is larger than the current value of `count`, it will cause an underflow. This means that the `count` variable will roll over to a very large number, which is not the expected behavior.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should add checks to ensure that the addition, multiplication, and subtraction operations do not result in overflow or underflow. 

Here is an example of how to prevent overflow in the addition function:
```solidity
require(count + input >= count, "Addition overflow");
count += input;
```
And an example for the subtraction function to prevent underflow:
```solidity
require(count >= input, "Subtraction underflow");
count -= input;
```

The contract does not seem to have the other vulnerabilities listed. However, without information about the environment in which the contract will be executed, it's impossible to completely rule out others like Time Manipulation or Front Running.
