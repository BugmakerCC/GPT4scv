The contract seems to have some vulnerabilities and issues:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks as it does not call external contracts while holding Ether.

2. Access Control: The contract does have owner-based access control implemented, but there are functions like `approveAndCall` which don't check for owner permissions. 

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract uses SafeMath library methods to prevent arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract seems to properly check the return values of the low level calls.

5. Denial of Service: The contract can potentially be vulnerable to denial of service attacks in the `refundTRA` function. If the `transfer` function fails, it can stop the execution for all users.

6. Bad Randomness: There is no randomness involved in the contract, so it's not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract is potentially vulnerable to front running attacks as transaction ordering can impact the outcome of transactions.

8. Time manipulation: There is no dependency on block timestamps, so the contract is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack as all critical functions require explicit inputs.

Apart from these vulnerabilities, there are some other issues as well:

- There are unused variables and events such as `otherchainstotalsupply`, `Chain1`, `Chain2`, `Chain3`, `Chain4`, `MigrationAgent` and event `Migrate`.

- The function `approveAndCall` can be potentially dangerous as it allows a potentially malicious contract to spend tokens on behalf of the user.

- In the `sendTokenAw` function, the contract assumes that the transfer will be successful without checking the return value of the transfer function.

- The contract lacks comments which makes it hard to understand the functioning and intention of the contract.

- There are magic numbers used in the contract which can lead to confusion and mistakes. For example, the number 12 is used in the `createDaoPOLSKAtokens` function without any explanation.

- The contract uses the throw statement which is deprecated in the latest versions of solidity. Using `require`, `assert` and `revert` is recommended.

- The `setBonusCreationRate` function can be potentially dangerous as it allows the owner to change the bonus creation rate arbitrarily. This can lead to trust issues with the users of the contract. 

Please note that this is a preliminary analysis and a thorough line by line review of the contract is recommended.
