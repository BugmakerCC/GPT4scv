The smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract doesn't seem to have any reentrancy vulnerabilities.

2. Access Control: The contract does have access control vulnerabilities. It allows the owner of the contract to change the owner. But the new owner has to accept the ownership. If the new owner is a contract that doesn't have a function to accept ownership, it may result in the contract being owned by no one.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract doesn't seem to have any arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does contain low level calls, specifically the `execute` function in the `Owned` contract. However, the return value from this call is not checked which may lead to unexpected behavior.

5. Denial of Service: The contract doesn't seem to have any Denial of Service vulnerabilities.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract doesn't seem to have any bad randomness vulnerabilities.

7. Front-Running: The contract doesn't seem to have any front-running vulnerabilities.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does use the `now` keyword for timestamping events, which can be manipulated by miners, but it does not appear to have any security critical functionality tied to these timestamps.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract doesn't seem to have any short address attack vulnerabilities.

In conclusion, the smart contract has vulnerabilities in access control and unchecked return values for low level calls. It's also worth noting that the functionality tied to the `now` keyword can be manipulated by miners.
