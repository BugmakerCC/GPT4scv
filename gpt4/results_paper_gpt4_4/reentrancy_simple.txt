The given smart contract suffers from a Reentrancy vulnerability. This is a common attack pattern in Ethereum smart contracts and can potentially allow an attacker to drain the contract of Ether.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function. When the contract sends Ether to the `msg.sender` address using the `call.value` function, it only sets the user balance to 0 after the transfer. If the `msg.sender` is a contract, it will call the fallback function where it can call `withdrawBalance` again before the user balance is set to 0. This is known as a reentrant call and can lead to the contract sending more Ether than it should.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by employing the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. This pattern involves performing checks (conditions that must be met for the transaction to pass), then changes to the contract's state, and finally interactions with other contracts.

Hereâ€™s a patched version of the `withdrawBalance` function:

```solidity
function withdrawBalance(){
    uint amount = userBalance[msg.sender];
    userBalance[msg.sender] = 0;
    if( ! (msg.sender.call.value(amount)() ) ){
        throw;
    }
}
```

In the patched version, the user balance is set to 0 before the contract interacts with the `msg.sender`. This prevents a reentrant call from being able to drain the contract of Ether, because when the reentrant call is made, the balance has already been set to 0. 

I didn't find other vulnerabilities listed in the contract snippet provided. However, it's important to note that a comprehensive security review would involve inspecting all contract code and considering all possible interactions between functions.
