The following vulnerabilities can be found in the provided smart contract:

1. Reentrancy (SWC-107): This vulnerability is not applicable to this contract as there are no external calls that send Ether in a function where the contract state has been altered before the call.

2. Access Control (SWC-115): The contract has access control implemented properly using the modifiers `onlyowner` and `onlymanyowners`. However, it's still important to ensure the contract is deployed with the correct initial set of owners.

3. Arithmetic Issues (SWC-101): The contract uses addition without checking for overflows in the `underLimit` function. However, this is not an issue because it does check that the addition does not overflow before performing the operation.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls (SWC-104): The contract uses low-level calls without checking their return value in the `execute` function. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the called contract throws an exception.

5. Denial of Service (SWC-128): This vulnerability is not applicable as the contract does not have a function that could be used by an attacker to indefinitely block operations.

6. Bad Randomness (SWC-120): This contract does not use randomness, so this vulnerability is not applicable.

7. Front-Running (SWC-114): The contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks as an attacker could see a transaction in the pending pool and then submit another transaction with a higher gas price to front-run the original transaction.

8. Time manipulation (SWC-116): The contract uses the `now` keyword, which can be manipulated by miners to a certain degree. This can affect the `today` function, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

9. Short Address Attack (SWC-103): This contract is not vulnerable to a short address attack as it does not take `msg.data` directly from an external call without checking its length.
