The smart contract provided has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The CashOut function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because the state variable `balances[msg.sender]` is updated after the external call `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`, which could allow the same function to be called multiple times before the state variable is updated.

2. Access Control: There are no access control mechanisms in place. Anybody can call any function in the contract including the `AddMessage` function in the Log contract which should ideally be restricted.

3. Arithmetic Issues: Although there are no immediate vulnerabilities to integer overflow or underflow, it's a good practice to use SafeMath library for arithmetic operations to prevent such issues in the future.

4. Unchecked Return Values: The return value of the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `CashOut` function isn't checked. In case of a failure, the function will silently continue execution.

5. Denial of Service: The fallback function is payable and without a function body. This can potentially allow an attacker to continuously send Ether to the contract, increasing the gas cost of transactions interacting with this contract.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable as there is no randomness involved in the contract.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable as there is no transaction ordering or timing critical operations in the contract.

8. Time manipulation: Not applicable as there is no reliance on block timestamp (`now` or `block.timestamp`) for critical operations.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable as there is no reliance on `msg.data.length` or similar properties that could be manipulated by a short address attack.

To fix these issues, it would be a good idea to implement a mechanism for access control, use SafeMath for arithmetic operations, check the return values of all external calls, and update state variables before making external calls to prevent reentrancy attacks. Also, consider limiting the amount of Ether that can be sent to the contract to prevent DoS attacks.
