Upon inspecting the given smart contract, the following vulnerabilities can be identified:

1. Reentrancy: The `redeem` and `withdraw` functions transfer ether to an external address. This can potentially allow a reentrancy attack by making a recursive call back to the contract before the balance is updated. A malicious contract can call these functions, which will then transfer the balance to the malicious contract, and then the malicious contract can recursively call the function again before the balance is updated.

2. Access Control: The `withdraw` and `Command` functions require that the caller is the owner of the contract. However, the contract allows for changing the owner in the `withdraw` function if the sender is a specific address. This could potentially allow a malicious entity who controls this address to take over the contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: No arithmetic operations are being performed in this contract, so it doesn't have any arithmetic issues related to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low Level Calls: The `Command` function uses a low level `call` function. The return value of this call is not checked which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

5. Denial of Service: The `redeem` function could potentially be exploited for a Denial of Service attack. If the contract's balance is less than the `minEligibility` value, then the contract will indefinitely be unable to send funds because the condition in the `redeem` function will never be satisfied.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness, so it doesn't have any bad randomness vulnerabilities.

7. Front-Running: There doesn't appear to be any Front-Running vulnerabilities as the contract does not depend on transaction ordering.

8. Time manipulation: The contract doesn't rely on timestamps or block numbers, so it doesn't have any time manipulation vulnerabilities.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract doesn't take any external inputs for addresses, so it doesn't have any short address attack vulnerabilities. However, it's always good practice to validate the length of the addresses.
