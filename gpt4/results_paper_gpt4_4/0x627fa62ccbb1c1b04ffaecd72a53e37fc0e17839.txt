The smart contract provided has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The WithdrawToHolder function is susceptible to a reentrancy attack because it calls an external contract before updating the state. An attacker can re-enter the contract and withdraw more funds than they should.

2. Access Control: The access control is flawed. The onlyOwner modifier intends to restrict access to certain functions to the owner only. However, it has a missing require statement. The correct implementation should be `require(msg.sender == owner);`.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not have any safeguards for integer overflow or underflow. For example, in the line `Holders[_addr]-=_wei;`, if `_wei` is greater than `Holders[_addr]`, it will underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The low-level call in the WithdrawToken function does not check the return value. If the call fails, the contract will not be aware of it.

5. Denial of Service: An attacker can create a contract that always throws an exception when receiving ether. If this contract is a holder, the WithdrawToHolder function will always fail, blocking all other holders from withdrawing.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable. The contract does not rely on randomness.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable. The contract does not depend on transaction ordering.

8. Time manipulation: Not applicable. The contract does not rely on timestamps.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable. The contract does not directly interact with user-provided addresses.

In conclusion, the contract has serious security issues that need to be addressed.
