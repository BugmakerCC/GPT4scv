The provided smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: 
The `send` function is used to transfer ether, but the return value of the `send` function is not checked in both `sendToWinner` and `withdrawLeftOver` functions. If the `send` function fails for any reason (for example, the recipient contract throws an error), the transaction does not revert and the state variable `payedOut` is set to true. This means the winner may not receive their payment but the contract behaves as though they have.

2. Denial of Service (DoS): 
The contract has a potential DoS vulnerability. If the winner contract fallback function consumes more than 2300 gas (the stipend given by `send`), the `send` function will fail and the `payedOut` variable will not be set to true. An attacker can create a contract with a fallback function that always fails, become the winner, and then block other participants from withdrawing their funds.

3. Access Control: 
There are no access control checks in this contract. Any user can call `withdrawLeftOver` and `sendToWinner` which may not be the intended behavior. Only the contract owner or the winner should be able to call these functions.

Note: 
This contract is not susceptible to the other mentioned vulnerabilities such as Reentrancy, Arithmetic Issues, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, or Short Address Attack, based on the provided code. However, the "... extra functionality here" comment suggests that there might be other functionalities not shown in the provided code which could potentially have these vulnerabilities.
