Looking at this smart contract, there seem to be multiple vulnerabilities present:

1. **Reentrancy**: The `WithdrawToHolder` and `WithdrawTokenToHolder` functions call external contracts (or addresses) before state changes. This means that if the called contract includes a fallback function, it could potentially call the function again before the state (e.g., balance) is updated, leading to a reentrancy attack.

2. **Unchecked Return Values**: The low-level `.call()` function is used in `WithdrawToken` and `WithdrawToHolder` functions without checking the return value. This function returns false if the call fails, but this isn't checked in the code, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

3. **Arithmetic Issues**: In the `Deposit` function, the user's balance is incremented using `+=`, but there is no check to ensure that this does not cause an integer overflow. 

4. **Access Control**: The `onlyOwner` modifier does not revert the transaction if the sender is not the owner. It only skips the function body. This could lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully handled in the function logic.

5. **Denial of Service**: If a malicious contract is used for the `_addr` parameter in `WithdrawToHolder` function, it could purposely fail to prevent other users from withdrawing their funds.

6. **Bad Randomness**: Not applicable in this contract.

7. **Front-Running**: Not directly applicable, but transactions changing or checking the contract state could potentially be front-run.

8. **Time manipulation**: Not applicable in this contract.

9. **Short Address Attack**: Not directly applicable, but if the address parameters are not properly validated, it could potentially lead to issues. 

These issues can be fixed by using SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, checking return values of `call` functions, using `transfer` or `send` instead of `call` for sending Ether, using `revert` in the `onlyOwner` modifier, and implementing reentrancy guards in functions that call external contracts.
