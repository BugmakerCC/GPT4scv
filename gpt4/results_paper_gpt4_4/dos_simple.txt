The given smart contract seems to have a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability related to the gas limit. This vulnerability is found in the 'ifillArray' function. 

In Ethereum, every operation costs a certain amount of gas, and a block has a gas limit which sets the maximum amount of gas all transactions in the block combined are allowed to consume.

Here, the function 'ifillArray' is pushing the address of the sender to the 'listAddresses' array up to 350 times in a loop. If the length of 'listAddresses' array is less than 1500, this could lead to a situation where the gas required to execute this function exceeds the block gas limit, especially when the 'listAddresses' array is already nearly 1500 in length. 

Once the gas limit is reached, execution will stop and all changes will be reverted, leaving the contract in a state where no further transactions can be processed, thus causing a denial of service.

The contract does not seem to have issues related to Reentrancy, Access Control, Arithmetic, Unchecked Return Values, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, or Short Address Attack. However, without knowing the complete context of the contract's use, there might still be potential risks related to these vulnerabilities.
