After analyzing the smart contract, the following vulnerabilities are detected:

1. Reentrancy vulnerability: This contract seems to be safe from a reentrancy attack because it correctly updates the balance of the user to 0 before the transfer is made.

2. Access control: The contract lacks proper access control functions or modifiers. Anyone can call the `increaseLockTime` function and increase the lock time of their funds.

3. Arithmetic issues: The contract does not handle potential integer underflow or overflow scenarios. This can lead to unexpected behavior. 

4. Unchecked return values: The contract does not check the return value of the `transfer` function. If the call to `transfer` fails for whatever reason, the contract will not be aware of this.

5. Denial of Service: The contract is vulnerable to a DoS attack. If an attacker’s fallback function runs out of gas or throws an error, the `withdraw` function will be stuck since it won’t be able to send Ether to the attacker’s contract.

6. Bad randomness: This contract does not seem to rely on randomness, so this vulnerability does not apply.

7. Front running: This contract does not seem to have functions that can be exploited through front running.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses the `now` keyword (alias for `block.timestamp`). Miner manipulation could potentially affect the outcome, but the effect is likely minimal in this case.

9. Short address attack: This contract does not seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack as it does not take address inputs from external calls.

Please note that this analysis is limited to the code provided and does not take into account the wider context in which this contract is used.
