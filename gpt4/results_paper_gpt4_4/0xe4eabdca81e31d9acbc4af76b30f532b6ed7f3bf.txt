1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. In the `GetFreebie` and `withdraw` functions, the contract transfers ether to an address before updating its state. This could allow an attacker to continuously call these functions and drain the contract of its funds.

2. Access Control: The contract is vulnerable to an access control issue. The `withdraw` function allows the `Owner` address to be changed to a specific hardcoded address. If the owner of that address is malicious, they can take control of the contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There doesn't seem to be any arithmetic operations that could lead to overflows or underflows.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low Level Calls: The `Command` function performs a low level `call` without checking its return value. If the call fails for any reason, the contract won't be aware of it and may continue to execute as if it was successful.

5. Denial of Service: There doesn't seem to be any potential Denial of Service vulnerabilities in this contract.

6. Bad Randomness: There doesn't seem to be any randomness in this contract, so it's not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: There doesn't appear to be any front-running vulnerabilities in this contract.

8. Time Manipulation: There's no reliance on time or block timestamps in this contract, so it's not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack as it doesn't take address inputs from users. 

Remember that this analysis is not exhaustive and other vulnerabilities may exist. Always make sure to have a professional security audit done before deploying a smart contract.
