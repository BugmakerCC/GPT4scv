The smart contract you provided has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to a Reentrancy attack in the `withdrawEther` function. Here, the contract first transfers Ether and then reduces the balance. An attacker can recursively call the `withdrawEther` function and drain the contract's Ether balance.

2. Access Control: There is no access control in the `withdrawTokens` and `withdrawEther` functions. Any address can call these functions and withdraw the tokens or Ether balance to the owner's address. There should be a modifier to restrict these functions only to the owner.

3. Unchecked Low Level Calls: The `addr.call.value(0 wei)();` is a low-level call and its return value is not checked. If this call fails for any reason, the entire transaction will not be reverted, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

4. Denial of Service: If an attacker sets the `num` variable to a very high value in the `getTokens` function, it can cause the contract to run out of gas and stop working, leading to a Denial of Service attack.

5. Timestamp Dependence: The contract does not appear to have any timestamp dependence vulnerabilities.

6. Arithmetic Issues, Bad Randomness, Front-Running and Short Address Attack: The contract does not appear to have these vulnerabilities.

Recommendations to fix these vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to avoid Reentrancy attacks. First, adjust the balance, then make the transfer.

2. Access Control: Add a modifier that only allows the owner to call the `withdrawTokens` and `withdrawEther` functions.

3. Unchecked Low Level Calls: Use Solidity's `transfer` function instead of low-level calls as it automatically reverts the transaction if the call fails.

4. Denial of Service: Add an upper limit to the `num` variable in the `getTokens` function to prevent it from being set to a very high value.
