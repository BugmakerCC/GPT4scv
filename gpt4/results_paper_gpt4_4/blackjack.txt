The smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Bad Randomness: The randomness in the `deal` function of the `Deck` library is predictable which could be exploited by a miner. It uses predictable variables like `block.number`, `block.timestamp`, and `block.blockhash` as seeds for the `keccak256` hashing function. This could allow an attacker to influence the outcome of the random number generation.

2. Front-Running: Since Ethereum miners can see the transactions in the mempool before they are mined, an attacker could use this to their advantage. For instance, if an attacker sees a transaction calling the `deal` function, they could send a transaction with a higher gas price to be included in the blockchain first, potentially influencing the outcome of the game.

3. Reentrancy: The `checkGameResult` function sends ether using `msg.sender.send` before setting the game's state to finished. This could potentially lead to a reentrancy attack where the recipient of the ether is a contract that calls back into `checkGameResult`, potentially causing unexpected outcomes.

4. DoS with (Unexpected) Throw: In `checkGameResult`, if the `send` function fails (for example, if the recipient is a contract that throws in its fallback function), it will cause the entire transaction to revert. This means the state of the game will not be updated, effectively making the game stuck in its current state.

5. Integer Overflow and Underflow: No safe math library is used for arithmetic operations. This can lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

6. Improper Error Handling: The contract uses `throw` for error handling which is a deprecated way of handling errors in Solidity. It should be replaced with `require` or `revert`.

7. Access Control: There are no access control mechanisms in the contract. Any address can call any function, leading to potential misuse.

8. Unchecked Return Values: The contract does not check the return value of the `send` function calls. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

9. Timestamp Dependence: The contract uses `block.timestamp` for randomness in the `deal` function. This can be manipulated by miners to a certain degree and could be used to influence the outcome of games. 

For improvement, consider implementing a more secure randomness generation, handle potential reentrancy attacks, check the return value of `send` calls, use a safe math library for arithmetic operations, implement proper access control, and replace `throw` with the newer error handling methods like `revert` or `require`.
