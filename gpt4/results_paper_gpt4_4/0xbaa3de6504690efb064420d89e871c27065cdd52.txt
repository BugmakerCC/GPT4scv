The smart contract provided has a couple of vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdraw` function in the `VaultProxy` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. After checking that `Deposits[msg.sender]` is greater than or equal to `amount`, the contract sends `amount` to `msg.sender`. A malicious contract could exploit this by causing its fallback function to be called, which then calls `withdraw` again. This can be done repeatedly before `Deposits[msg.sender]` is ever decreased, thus draining the contract of Ether.

2. Access Control: The `onlyOwner` modifier is declared in both `Proxy` and `VaultProxy` contracts but only implemented in the `Proxy` contract. This might lead to unexpected behavior if an address other than the owner tries to call the `withdraw` function.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `proxy` function in the `Proxy` contract uses `call.value()`, a low-level call, without checking the return value. If the call fails, no exception is thrown and execution continues. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

4. Arithmetic Issue: In the `deposit` function of the `VaultProxy` contract, the line `Deposits[msg.sender] += msg.value;` is vulnerable to an integer overflow attack. If `msg.value` is large enough, it could cause the balance of `Deposits[msg.sender]` to roll over to a very small number.

Please note that this is a high-level analysis and might not cover all potential vulnerabilities. For a full audit, a more thorough investigation is needed.
