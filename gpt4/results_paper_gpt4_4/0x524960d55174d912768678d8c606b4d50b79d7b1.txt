The provided smart contract seems to have the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not seem to have a direct reentrancy vulnerability. However, due to the use of the low-level `call` function, a reentrancy attack could be possible if the called contract has a fallback function that calls back into this contract.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any access control implemented. This means that any address can call the `transfer` function.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There is no arithmetic operation in the contract, so there are no integer overflow or underflow issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The return value of the `call` function is not checked. This could lead to silent failing of the function call.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not seem to have a Denial of Service vulnerability. However, if the called contract consumes a lot of gas, it could potentially reach the gas limit.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness, so there are no issues here.

7. Front-Running: As there is no state change based on an input value, there is no front-running vulnerability.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not use timestamps, so there is no time manipulation vulnerability.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to have a short address attack vulnerability, as all addresses are hardcoded.

Note: It's important to mention that this contract has a significant security issue with hard-coded addresses, which is not a good practice and can lead to serious security problems.
