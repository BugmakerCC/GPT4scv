After analyzing the provided smart contract code, I've identified the following potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not appear to have a reentrancy vulnerability since it does not make any external calls in the middle of a function execution.

2. Access control: There's a potential access control vulnerability in the `forceReseed()` function and `kill()` function. Only the contract owner should be able to call these functions, and while there is a `require(msg.sender==owner)` statement, it would be more secure to use an explicit modifier for this.

3. Arithmetic issues: The contract is potentially vulnerable to an integer underflow at `block.number-lastReseed>1000` in the `participate()` function, if `lastReseed` is greater than `block.number`. However, under normal circumstances, this should never happen as the `block.number` is always increasing.

4. Unchecked return values: The contract does not check the return value of the `msg.sender.transfer(win)` call in the `participate()` function. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the transfer fails.

5. Denial of Service: The contract could potentially be vulnerable to a DoS attack if an attacker repeatedly calls the `participate()` function and the contract's balance is not enough to cover the potential winnings. This could drain the contract's funds and prevent legitimate users from winning.

6. Bad randomness: The contract relies on block variables (like `block.coinbase`, `block.difficulty`, `block.gaslimit`, `block.timestamp`) to generate a random number in the `reseed()` function. This could potentially be manipulated by a miner and is not a reliable source of randomness.

7. Front-Running: There's a potential for front-running attacks because the result of the lottery is determinable before the transaction is mined. An attacker can see if they are going to win the lottery by calling `luckyNumberOfAddress()` and if they are not going to win, they can choose not to broadcast their transaction.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract could be vulnerable to time manipulation attacks as it uses `block.timestamp` for generating a random seed. A miner can slightly adjust the timestamp to affect the outcome of the lottery.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not appear to be vulnerable to short address attacks, as it does not directly interact with user-supplied input in a manner that would expose it to such attacks. 

Please note that this analysis is not exhaustive, and the contract may contain other vulnerabilities. Also, it is always recommended to get your smart contract audited by a professional security firm before deploying it on the mainnet.
