There are several vulnerabilities in the given smart contract:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attack in the `GetFreebie` and `withdraw` functions. After the condition check, there is a call to `transfer` that sends ether to an external address. An attacker can make a recursive call back into the smart contract and drain its balance. 

2. Access Control: The contract lacks proper access control checks. The `Owner` can be changed in the `withdraw` function by anyone who knows the hardcoded address.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic issues in this contract since there are no mathematical operations.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `call` function in `Command` does not check the return value. If the call fails, the contract will not be aware.

5. Denial of Service: In the `GetFreebie` function, if the `msg.value` is more than 1 ether, the contract tries to transfer the entire balance to the `msg.sender`. If the balance is less than `msg.value`, the transfer will fail and throw an exception, halting the execution of the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any random numbers, so there is no problem with this.

7. Front-Running: Front-Running can occur in the `GetFreebie` function where an attacker can see a transaction where `msg.value` is more than 1 ether and front-run the transaction by sending a transaction with a higher gas price.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on block timestamps, so there is no time manipulation vulnerability.

9. Short Address Attack: All address variables are of correct length and there are no off-chain issues related to address length.
