The smart contract provided has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is susceptible to reentrancy in the `withdraw(uint _value)` and `sendMoney(address _target, uint _value)` functions. After the `call.value(_value)()` function call, the contract's state is not updated. This can allow a malicious contract to continuously call the `withdraw` or `sendMoney` function and drain the contract's Ether.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses the `call.value(_value)()` function in the `sendMoney` function. This function call does not check the return value, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

3. Access Control: Although the contract has implemented a modifier for access control (`onlyOwner`), it does not provide a function for changing the owner of the contract. If the owner loses their private key, the contract would be locked forever.

4. Denial of Service: The fallback function increments the `depositsCount` state variable each time it is called with Ether. Since there is no limit on the number of deposits, a malicious user could continuously send Ether in small amounts to bloat the contract's state and make it too expensive to use.

5. Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, Short Address Attack and Arithmetic Issues do not appear to be present in this contract.

In general, this contract should avoid using the `call.value(_value)()` function, which can lead to reentrancy attacks, and instead use the `transfer` or `send` functions, which automatically check for failures and limit the amount of gas forwarded. Additionally, the contract should implement a way to change the owner and limit the number of deposits to prevent a denial of service attack.
