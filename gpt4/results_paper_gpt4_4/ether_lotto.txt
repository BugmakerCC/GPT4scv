This smart contract for EtherLotto has several vulnerabilities:

1. Bad Randomness: The smart contract uses the `block.timestamp` for generating a pseudo-random number. Miners can manipulate the timestamp to some extent, which makes this randomness insecure.

2. Reentrancy: The `play()` function has a potential for a reentrancy attack. A malicious contract could override the fallback function to call back into `play()` when `msg.sender.transfer(pot - FEE_AMOUNT);` is executed, potentially draining the contract of its funds.

3. Denial of Service: The contract sends funds with `msg.sender.transfer(pot - FEE_AMOUNT);`. If the receiving contract's fallback function consumes more than the gas stipend (2300 gas), the transfer will fail, causing the EtherLotto contract to be stuck.

4. Arithmetic Issues: There are no checks for integer overflow or underflow. However, since this contract only deals with a fixed ticket amount and fee, this might not be a problem here.

5. Access Control: The `bank` variable can potentially be manipulated since it's public. It's set in the constructor, but there's no mechanism in place to prevent it from being changed later.

6. Unchecked Return Values: The contract does not check the return value of the `transfer` function. Although this is not a concern with the current solidity version as `transfer` will throw an error if unsuccessful, it's a good practice to handle potential failures.

7. Front Running: Players can potentially see other players' moves before transactions are confirmed, giving them an advantage.

8. Time Manipulation: As mentioned above, the contract is vulnerable to timestamp manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack as it doesn't take address inputs from users.

In addition to these vulnerabilities, it's also worth noting that this contract does not follow the latest Solidity version, which has more security features and fixes for known vulnerabilities.
