This contract has at least one vulnerability:

1. Bad Randomness: The contract relies on blockhash for randomness. However, the Ethereum Yellow Paper specifies that blockhash only works for the 256 most recent blocks, and will return zero for older blocks. This means an attacker can wait for the block to be more than 256 blocks old, and then guess zero. This is an example of the "Bad Randomness" vulnerability, also known as "nothing is secret". 

There is no evidence of the other mentioned vulnerabilities in this contract:

2. Reentrancy: There are no recursive calls or calls to external contracts that could allow for reentrancy.

3. Access Control: The contract does not appear to have any functions that are restricted to certain roles.

4. Arithmetic Issues: All arithmetic operations seem to handle edge cases correctly.

5. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: There are no low-level calls (like call, delegatecall, or callcode) that could fail silently.

6. Denial of Service: There are no loops or large arrays that could consume too much gas and cause a denial of service.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not seem to be prone to front-running, as users cannot benefit from being able to order their transactions in a certain way.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on block.timestamp for critical operations, so it is not vulnerable to timestamp manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: This attack vector is more relevant to off-chain transaction signing, which this contract does not do.
