The smart contract provided has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: In the Collect function, there is a reentrancy vulnerability where the state (balances[msg.sender]) is not updated before the external call to msg.sender. This means that a malicious contract can recursively call the Collect function before the state is updated and drain the contract's Ether.

2. Access Control: There are no access control checks on the functions SetMinSum, SetLogFile, and Initialized. This means any address can call these functions and modify the state of the contract. There should ideally be a check to ensure that only the contract owner or authorized addresses can call these functions.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: In the Collect function, there is a low level call (msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) without checking its return value. If this call fails for any reason, the contract will not be able to detect it.

4. Denial of Service: If a malicious contract is used as the recipient in the Collect function, it can cause a denial of service attack by always throwing an exception and thus blocking the execution of the function.

5. Time Manipulation: The LogFile contract uses the now keyword to get the current timestamp. This could potentially be manipulated by miners and should not be used for critical logic.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable as there is no randomness involved in this contract.

7. Front-running: Not applicable as there is no transaction ordering or time of check to time of use issue in this contract.

8. Short Address Attack: Not applicable as there is no direct interaction with user-supplied addresses.

The Arithmetic Issues vulnerability isn't present here, as there is no arithmetic operation that could potentially overflow or underflow. However, it's always a good practice to use SafeMath library for arithmetic operations in Solidity.
