The contract provided has at least two potential vulnerabilities:

1. Denial of Service (DoS) with Unchecked Return Values: The function `refundAll()` sends ether to all addresses in the `refundAddresses` array. However, if the `send()` function fails for any reason (e.g., the recipient contract throws an exception, or the call stack depth limit is reached), the `require` statement will cause the entire transaction to revert. This can create a DoS vulnerability where a single failing address can prevent all the other addresses from receiving their refunds.

2. Gas Limit: The `refundAll()` function iterates over the `refundAddresses` array without limiting the number of iterations. If the number of addresses is very large, the function could exceed the block gas limit, making it impossible to call. This is a form of Denial of Service (DoS) attack known as a 'gas limit attack'. 

To fix these vulnerabilities, you could change the `refundAll()` function to refund one address at a time, rather than all at once. This would prevent one failing address from affecting the others. Additionally, to prevent gas limit attacks, you could limit the number of addresses that can be added to the `refundAddresses` array, or implement a mechanism to process refunds in batches.
