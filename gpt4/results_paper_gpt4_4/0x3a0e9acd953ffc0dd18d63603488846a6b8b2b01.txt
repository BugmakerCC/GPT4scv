This smart contract has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `WithdrawToken` and `WithdrawToHolder` functions are vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. They first send ether or tokens to the `_addr` or `_to` addresses and then update the balance of `Holders[_addr]` or `Holders[_to]`. An attacker can use this vulnerability to drain the contract by making a fallback function that calls `WithdrawToken` or `WithdrawToHolder` again before the balance is updated.

2. Arithmetic Issues: Although not explicitly shown in this contract, arithmetic operations without the SafeMath library can potentially lead to overflows or underflows.

3. Unchecked Return Values: The low-level calls (`call.value()` and `token.call()`) do not check the return value. If these calls fail, the contract will not be aware and will continue execution.

4. Access Control: The `onlyOwner` modifier doesn't revert the transaction when `msg.sender` is not the owner. It should use `require(owner == msg.sender)` to ensure that only the owner can execute functions with this modifier.

5. Denial of Service: The `WithdrawToHolder` and `WithdrawToken` functions are vulnerable to the denial of service attack. If the recipient contract's fallback function consumes a lot of gas or reverts, these functions will not be able to execute.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable in this contract, as it does not use any random number generation.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable in this contract, as it does not involve any operations that could be front-run.

8. Time Manipulation: Not applicable in this contract, as it does not rely on block timestamps or block numbers.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable in this contract, as it does not take any externally supplied addresses in a `msg.data` or external function calls. 

To resolve these issues, I recommend using the reentrancy guard, checking return values of all external calls, using SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, and fixing the `onlyOwner` modifier. It's also important to consider potential gas limit problems in the recipient's fallback function.
