Analyzing the given smart contract, it seems to have the following vulnerabilities:

1. **Bad Randomness (Nothing is Secret)**: The contract uses `keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now)` to generate a pseudo-random number, but these parameters are not truly random. `blockhash` and `block.number` can be predicted by miners, and `now` is the current block timestamp which can also be influenced by miners up to a certain degree. This leads to predictable randomness which is a major security issue.

2. **Denial of Service**: In the function `guess`, if the guess is correct, the contract tries to transfer 2 ethers to `msg.sender`. However, if the contract does not have sufficient balance, this call will fail and effectively lock the contract, hence leading to a potential Denial of Service.

3. **Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls**: When transferring ethers with `msg.sender.transfer(2 ether)`, the contract does not handle any potential failure of this call. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the transfer fails.

4. **Access Control**: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms. Anyone can call the `guess` function and potentially drain the contract if they can correctly predict the "random" number.

5. **Arithmetic Issues (Integer Underflow/Overflow)**: Although not directly apparent in this contract, it's worth noting to always use SafeMath library or similar checks to prevent overflows or underflows in arithmetic operations.

The other vulnerabilities mentioned (Reentrancy, Front-Running, Time manipulation, Short Address Attack) don't seem to apply directly to this contract. However, always include checks and measures to prevent these in your smart contracts.
