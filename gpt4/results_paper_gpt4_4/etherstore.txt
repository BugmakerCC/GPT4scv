This smart contract contains a reentrancy vulnerability, which is one of the most common and critical vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

The issue lies within the `withdrawFunds` function. It uses the `call.value()` function to send Ether, which is a low-level function that can potentially allow a contract to fall into a reentrancy attack. This is because `call.value()` hands over control to the called contract and any state changes (like changing balances) after this call can be ignored.

In this case, the balance of the user is updated after the Ether is sent (`balances[msg.sender] -= _weiToWithdraw;`). An attacker could create a malicious contract that, when receiving Ether, immediately calls `withdrawFunds` again (before the first transaction completed and the balance was updated). This allows the attacker to drain the contract as the balance check (`require(balances[msg.sender] >= _weiToWithdraw);`) will pass.

To fix this issue, the Ether transfer should be the last operation in the function. The state should be updated before any calls to external contracts are made:

```
function withdrawFunds (uint256 _weiToWithdraw) public {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _weiToWithdraw);
    // limit the withdrawal
    require(_weiToWithdraw <= withdrawalLimit);
    // limit the time allowed to withdraw
    require(now >= lastWithdrawTime[msg.sender] + 1 weeks);
    
    balances[msg.sender] -= _weiToWithdraw;
    lastWithdrawTime[msg.sender] = now;
    
    require(msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)());
}
```

Moreover, it's also recommended to use `transfer()` or `send()` instead of `call.value()` to prevent reentrancy attacks. These functions don't forward any gas to the receiver, making reentrancy impossible.
