The smart contract provided has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: There doesn't appear to be a reentrancy vulnerability in this contract as there are no callbacks to external contracts that could potentially lead to recursive calls.

2. Access Control: There is a significant access control vulnerability. The `forward` function can be called by anyone and not just the `owner`. This allows for potential malicious calls to be made.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations being performed in this contract, so there are no arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `delegatecall` function is used, which is a low-level call. However the return value is checked with a `require` statement, this doesn't appear to be an issue.

5. Denial of Service: There doesn't appear to be a denial of service vulnerability. 

6. Bad Randomness: There is no randomness used in this contract, so there is no vulnerability related to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: There are no transaction ordering or timing dependencies, so there is no front-running vulnerability.

8. Time manipulation: There are no timestamp dependencies, so there is no time manipulation vulnerability.

9. Short Address Attack: There doesn't appear to be a short address attack vulnerability, as the contract doesn't handle any token transfers or similar functions that could be exploited.

In conclusion, the main vulnerability of this contract is the Access Control problem, where anyone could call the `forward` function. This could be rectified by adding a `require` statement to ensure that `msg.sender` is the `owner`.
