The given smart contract has multiple vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it has a call to the `transfer` function before it has finished modifying its state. An attacker could recursively call the contract's fallback function, draining the contract's Ether.

2. Arithmetic Issues: Though not immediately apparent, the contract could potentially run into arithmetic issues like underflow and overflow. However, given the nature of this contract, it seems unlikely.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The contract doesn't check the return value of the `transfer` function. Although `transfer` is considered safe against reentrancy and it will revert in case of failure, it's always a good practice to check its return value.

4. Denial of Service: The contract is vulnerable to DoS attacks. An attacker could perpetually be the first to transact in each block, making it impossible for others to interact with the contract.

5. Bad Randomness: The contract uses `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) for randomness. Miners have slight influence over this value, making it possible to manipulate the outcome.

6. Front-Running: The contract is also vulnerable to front-running because the state of the contract can be observed and interacted with publicly. An attacker can observe a transaction and then place their own transaction with a higher gas price, hence "front-running" the original.

7. Time Manipulation: The contract uses `now` for critical functionality (determining if someone has won). As mentioned before, `now` is not entirely reliable because miners can slightly manipulate it.

8. No obvious signs of Access Control or Short Address Attack vulnerabilities are present in this contract.

Please note that this analysis is not exhaustive, and the contract could potentially have other security risks as well.
