Looking at this smart contract, I can see that there are a few potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdraw` function could be susceptible to a reentrancy attack. If the contract calls an untrusted contract (a contract that is not part of the DApp and can be deployed by an adversary) with a function that calls back into the vulnerable contract, it could cause the contract to enter a state that the developer did not anticipate.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `sendMoney` function uses a low level `.call.value()` function which can fail silently because it does not throw an exception when it fails, the return value is not checked. This function should be replaced with `transfer` or `send` functions, or the return value should be checked.

3. Access Control: Although there is an `onlyOwner` modifier in place to restrict access to certain functions, if the owner address is compromised, an attacker could access these functions. There is no function to change the owner in case the owner's private key is lost or stolen.

4. Bad Randomness: Not applicable in this contract.

5. Front-Running: Not applicable in this contract.

6. Time Manipulation: Not applicable in this contract.

7. Short Address Attack: Not applicable in this contract.

8. Denial of Service: Not applicable in this contract.

9. Arithmetic Issues: The `depositsCount` variable could be susceptible to an Integer Overflow, but in practice, this is highly unlikely because the number of deposits that can cause this to overflow in Solidity is extremely high. However, it should be noted as a potential vulnerability.

It's worth noting that this is a simple analysis and a more thorough audit may find other potential issues or vulnerabilities.
