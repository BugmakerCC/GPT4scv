The main vulnerability in this contract is Denial of Service (DoS) due to the gas limit, which is a part of the 5th vulnerability category. 

This occurs in two places: 
1. The `insertNnumbers` function: If the `numbers` input is a large number, the gas cost of the transaction may exceed the block gas limit, causing the transaction to fail.
2. The `clearDOS` function: If the `array` has a large length, the gas cost of re-initializing it to an empty array can exceed the block gas limit, causing the transaction to fail. 

Apart from this, it doesn't seem like the contract has any arithmetic issues since no arithmetic operations are conducted without checks, and all instances of addition are controlled and cannot overflow an UINT. 

There are also no unchecked return values from low level calls, no bad randomness, no possibility of front-running or time manipulation. Access control could be an issue if the `clear` and `clearDOS` functions aren't meant to be accessed by everyone, but the contract doesn't specify this. 

Lastly, there's no potential for a short address attack since all address related operations are absent. 

The contract could potentially improve by implementing a pull payment system rather than pushing payments to avoid gas limit issues. It could also benefit from having access control in place for functions like `clear` and `clearDOS` to prevent anyone from clearing the array.
