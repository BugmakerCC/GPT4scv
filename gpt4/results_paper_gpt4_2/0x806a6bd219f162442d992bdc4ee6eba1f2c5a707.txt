This smart contract has multiple potential vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: In the `GetPie` and `withdraw` functions, it is not safe to call the `transfer` method before changing the state. An attacker might be able to recursively call the `GetPie` or `withdraw` function before the contract state is updated, draining the contract balance.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have a proper access control mechanism. The `Command` function allows the `Owner` to execute any function on any contract without any restrictions. An attacker who gains ownership can misuse this function.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There is no check for arithmetic overflows or underflows in this contract.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` in the `Command` function is a low-level call that ignores the return value. If this call fails, the contract will not be aware of it, leading to unexpected behavior.

5. Denial of Service: By sending repeated `GetPie` requests with `msg.value>1 ether`, a malicious actor could potentially drain the contract of its funds, effectively causing a denial of service.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness, so this vulnerability does not apply.

7. Front-Running: There doesn't seem to be a specific front-running vulnerability in this contract.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not use any time or block information, so this vulnerability does not apply.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract does not take any address as input from users, so it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.

Recommendations for fixing these issues would include implementing safe arithmetic operations, checking the return values of external calls, and implementing a better access control mechanism. Also, the state should be changed before transferring funds to prevent reentrancy attacks.
