The smart contract seems to have a Reentrancy vulnerability in the `execute` function, where external calls are made to an arbitrary address before state changes. This can allow an attacker to repeatedly call the function before the state (in this case, the `m_txs[_h]` state) is changed, draining the contract's funds.

Here's the problematic part:

```solidity
if (m_txs[_h].to != 0 || m_txs[_h].value != 0 || m_txs[_h].data.length != 0) {
    address created;
    if (m_txs[_h].to == 0) {
        created = create(m_txs[_h].value, m_txs[_h].data);
    } else {
        if (!m_txs[_h].to.call.value(m_txs[_h].value)(m_txs[_h].data))
            throw;
    }

    MultiTransact(msg.sender, _h, m_txs[_h].value, m_txs[_h].to, m_txs[_h].data, created);
    delete m_txs[_h];
    return true;
}
```

Before making an external call to `_to.call.value(_value)(_data)`, the state `m_txs[_h]` should be deleted or modified.

In addition, the smart contract seems to have an Access Control vulnerability. `Onlyowner` and `Onlymanyowners` are defined but never used, which means that any address can use the functions in this contract. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract's state.

Lastly, the contract suffers from a Time manipulation (timestamp dependence) vulnerability. The `today` function returns the current day based on the `now` keyword which can be manipulated by miners. This can be a problem where the function is used in `underLimit` to reset daily spending limits.

```solidity
function today() private constant returns (uint) { return now / 1 days; }
```

These vulnerabilities should be addressed to ensure the secure operation of the smart contract.
