The given smart contract contains the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the `CashOut()` function. The balance of the sender is updated only after the external call `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. An attacker could re-enter the `CashOut()` function before the balance is updated and withdraw more Ether than they should.

2. Access Control: There are no access control measures in place to restrict who can call the `AddMessage()` function in the `Log` contract. This means that any user could add arbitrary messages to the log.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses a low-level `call` function in the `CashOut()` function but does not check the return value. If the call were to fail, the contract wouldn't know and could potentially continue to execute with incorrect assumptions.

4. Denial of Service: An attacker could intentionally fail the `call` in the `CashOut()` function, causing the user's funds to be locked in the contract indefinitely.

5. Bad Randomness: This contract doesn't have any randomness-related functionality, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

6. Front-Running: This smart contract does not deal with transaction ordering or time-of-check/time-of-use, so it is not vulnerable to front-running.

7. Time Manipulation: This contract is not vulnerable to time manipulation as it does not use the `block.timestamp`.

8. Short Address Attack: This contract is not vulnerable to a short address attack because it doesn't use `msg.data.length` or a similar pattern to determine the length of the input.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the contract should implement the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, add access control measures, and check the return value of the `call` function.
