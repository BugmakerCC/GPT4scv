This smart contract has a few vulnerabilities:

1. Bad Randomness: The contract uses `block.timestamp` to generate a random number. However, `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners to some extent. Therefore, it's not a good source of randomness and can be exploited by an attacker to increase their chances of winning.

2. Denial of Service: The function `play()` transfers ether to the `msg.sender`. If the fallback function of the sender contract consumes more than 2300 gas (the stipend for a transfer call), this transfer will fail but the contract doesn't handle this failure. An attacker can create a contract with a fallback function that exceeds the gas limit, buy a ticket and become the only winner, because all further transactions will fail.

3. Reentrancy: Although reentrancy is not an issue in this contract because there's no function call after the ether transfer, it's always a good practice to use the checks-effects-interactions pattern where you perform any external calls or send ether at the end of the function.

4. Integer Overflow and Underflow: This contract does not check for overflows or underflows.

5. Front-Running: The winner is selected based on the `block.timestamp`. An attacker could potentially see the transaction in the mempool, calculate the winning conditions, and then front-run the transaction with higher gas to increase their chances of winning.

6. Access Control: The contract doesn't implement any access control mechanisms. This is not inherently a vulnerability, but it's worth mentioning as a potential area for improvement.

7. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: Not an issue in this contract as `transfer` is used which handles failed calls but it's good to keep this vulnerability in mind.

8. Time manipulation: As mentioned earlier, `block.timestamp` is used for randomness which can be manipulated.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable here.

In conclusion, this contract is vulnerable to various attacks such as bad randomness, denial of service, front-running, and potentially others, and should be improved for better security.
