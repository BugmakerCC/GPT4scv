The smart contract provided has an Arithmetic Issue vulnerability, specifically an Integer Underflow.

In the function `run()`, the operation `count -= input;` can underflow if the `input` is greater than `count`. In Solidity, unsigned integers are used, which means they cannot be negative. If an operation would result in a negative number, the integer underflows and wraps around to a very large number (2^256 - 1). 

To fix this vulnerability, a condition check should be added before the subtraction operation to ensure the `input` is not greater than `count`.

Here is the corrected code:

```solidity
function run(uint256 input) {
    require(input <= count, "Input is greater than count. Underflow prevented.");
    if (initialized == 0) {
        return;
    }
        
    count -= input;
}
```

The `require()` function will cause the function to revert if the condition is not met, preventing the underflow.

Lastly, the contract does not seem to have any other vulnerabilities from the provided list. The `init()` function cannot be called more than once due to lack of check but it doesn't seem to cause any vulnerabilities in this specific contract. However, it's a bad practice and you should add a check to prevent it from being called more than once.
