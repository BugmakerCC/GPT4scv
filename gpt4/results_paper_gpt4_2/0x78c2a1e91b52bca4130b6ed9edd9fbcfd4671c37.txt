Upon inspecting this smart contract, several vulnerabilities are apparent:

1. Reentrancy: The `redeem()` function is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack because it sends out Ether with `transfer()` before it updates the state of the contract. An attacker can recursively call the `redeem()` function to drain the contract of all its Ether.

2. Access Control: This smart contract is vulnerable to an access control issue because the `Owner` of the contract can be changed in the `withdraw()` function. If the sender of the transaction is `0x7a617c2B05d2A74Ff9bABC9d81E5225C1e01004b`, the `Owner` of the contract is changed to this address, which could be controlled by a potential attacker. 

3. Arithmetic Issues: This contract does not appear to have any obvious arithmetic issues such as integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values: The `Command()` function uses a low-level `.call()` function without checking the return value which could be false if the call fails.

5. Denial of Service: An attacker could always make sure that `msg.value` is greater than or equal to `minEligibility` in the `redeem()` function and continuously call the function to drain all funds from the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: This contract does not use any random number generation, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: This contract does not appear to have vulnerabilities related to front-running.

8. Time Manipulation: This contract does not use block.timestamp or now keywords, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack because it does not directly interact with user-provided addresses (except for `Command` function, but it does not perform any arithmetic operations with it).
   
Please note that this is a basic analysis. A more thorough audit might uncover additional issues.
