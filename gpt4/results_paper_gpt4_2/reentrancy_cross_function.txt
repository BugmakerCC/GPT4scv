This contract appears to have a Reentrancy vulnerability. 

In the `withdrawBalance` function, the contract calls `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("")`, which sends Ether to the address that called the function. If the receiving address is a contract, it will execute its fallback function. This fallback function can call `withdrawBalance` again, before the first call to `withdrawBalance` has finished. This means it can drain more Ether than it should be able to, because `userBalances[msg.sender]` isn't set to 0 until after the call.value has occurred.

One way to prevent this is by using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, where you perform any checks at the beginning of the function, update the contractâ€™s state before calling other contracts, and only then interact with other contracts.

Here's the corrected contract:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract Reentrancy_cross_function {

    // INSECURE
    mapping (address => uint) private userBalances;

    function transfer(address to, uint amount) {
        if (userBalances[msg.sender] >= amount) {
            userBalances[to] += amount;
            userBalances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        }
    }

    function withdrawBalance() public {
        uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
        // Avoid re-entrancy by zeroing out user balance before the external call.
        userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
        
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)(""); // At this point, the caller's code is executed, and can call transfer()
        require(success);
    }
}
```
Please note that using `call.value()` is also risky because it can lead to unforeseen consequences due to the execution of the called contract's fallback function. It's generally safer to use `transfer` or `send` which limit the gas provided to the called contract, preventing it from performing complex operations.
