This smart contract has a few vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: In the `CashOut` function, the balance of the user is decreased after the call to the user's address. This could allow a user to recursively call the `CashOut` function before the first call has finished, effectively draining the contract's Ether.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `call.value()` function is a low level function that doesn't throw an exception when it fails but returns false instead. If the function call fails, the error is not checked and the execution continues.

3. Denial of Service: An attacker can force the contract to fail by making the fallback function of the caller consume all gas, or by causing the `call.value()` function to fail by calling it with an address that has no associated code.

4. Access Control: The `AddMessage` function in the Log contract is public, which allows any address to add messages to the log.

5. Bad Randomness: Although there's no randomness in this contract, it's still important to remember that `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) should not be used for generating random numbers, as it can be manipulated by miners.

6. Arithmetic Issues: No checks for overflows or underflows in mathematical operations. However, this isn't an issue in this particular contract.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable to this contract.

8. Time manipulation: The `now` keyword is used to set `LastMsg.Time` in the `AddMessage` function, which could be manipulated by miners.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to this attack. 

Overall, the most critical vulnerabilities in this contract are reentrancy and unchecked return values for low level calls.
