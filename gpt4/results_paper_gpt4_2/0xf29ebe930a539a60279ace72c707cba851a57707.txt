This smart contract exhibits several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `go` is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it calls an external contract (the `target`) before it finishes its execution and updates the state (the `owner.transfer(address(this).balance)` line). The external contract could call back into `go`, and it would start executing on a new stack frame. This process could be repeated until the contract's ether is drained.

2. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The `.call.value()` function is a low-level function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the call was successful or not. This value is not checked in the code, so if the call fails for any reason, the contract will not be aware of this, and it will continue executing as if nothing happened. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

3. Denial of Service: The `owner.transfer(address(this).balance)` line could be blocked if the `owner` is a contract with a fallback function that consumes a lot of gas or throws an exception. If the `owner` becomes a malicious contract, it can block the `go` function permanently.

4. Access Control: There is no access control mechanism in the `go` function. Anyone can call this function and potentially drain the contract's funds.

The contract does not seem to exhibit arithmetic issues, bad randomness, front-running, time manipulation, or short address attack vulnerabilities. However, it's important to note that the visibility for the `owner` state variable should be restricted to better enforce access control.
