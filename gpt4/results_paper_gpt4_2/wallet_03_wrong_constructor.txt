This contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Access Control: The function `initWallet()` can reset the `creator` of the contract to the `msg.sender`. This means that anyone can become the owner of the contract and withdraw all funds by calling `migrateTo(address to)` function. This is a serious access control vulnerability.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `transfer` function is used without checking its return value. This could lead to a situation where a failed transfer goes unnoticed.

3. Denial of Service: If the `migrateTo` function is called with an address that throws an exception when receiving ether (e.g., a contract that reverts in its fallback function), then nobody will be able to withdraw their ether anymore.

4. Reentrancy: The function `withdraw(uint256 amount)` is vulnerable to Reentrancy attacks. The state (`balances[msg.sender] -= amount;`) is changed after the call (`msg.sender.transfer(amount);`). An attacker can recursively call the `withdraw` function and drain the contract of its funds.

To secure the contract, consider the following changes:

- The `creator` should be set in the constructor of the contract and the constructor should be properly named (as the same name as the contract). This would avoid the access control issue.

- A `require` statement should be added after each `transfer` function to ensure that it completes successfully.

- The state should be changed before the call in the `withdraw` function to prevent reentrancy attacks.

- Add a mechanism to prevent the contract from becoming stuck if a `migrateTo` transfer fails. For example, only allow `migrateTo` function to be executed by the `creator` and ensure the `to` address does not contain code.
