The smart contract you provided presents a few vulnerabilities:

1. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: In the `transfer` function, the `call` function is used to make a low-level call to another contract. The return value of this call is not checked, which means that if the call fails, the contract will not be able to detect it.

2. Reentrancy: Although the contract does not directly handle Ether (ETH), the `transfer` function could potentially be used in a reentrancy attack if the `contract_address` passed as an argument is a malicious contract. This is because the `transfer` function calls the `transferFrom` function of the `contract_address` inside a loop, without any reentrancy guards in place.

3. Access Control: The `transfer` function is public and does not have any access control mechanism in place. This means that anyone can call this function and potentially abuse it.

4. Denial of Service: If the `tos` and `vs` arrays passed to the `transfer` function are large, it could potentially cause the function to run out of gas, leading to a denial of service.

5. Arithmetic Issues: While this contract does not perform any arithmetic calculations, if it were to, it would be vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow as it does not use SafeMath or a similar library to handle these operations.

Please remember that smart contract security is complex and this analysis might not cover every possible vulnerability. Therefore, it's recommended to have your contracts audited by a professional security firm.
