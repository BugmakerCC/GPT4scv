The smart contract provided here uses the SafeMath library for all arithmetic operations which helps prevent arithmetic issues such as integer overflow and integer underflow. 

However, the contract may have some potential vulnerabilities:

1. No reentrancy vulnerability is found in this contract as there are no external calls made before the state update. 

2. No explicit access control vulnerability is found in the contract. The onlyOwner modifier is correctly used in the Ownable contract to restrict access to the owner only. 

3. The contract might be subject to a front-running vulnerability because the transaction ordering in Ethereum is determined by miners. For instance, a malicious miner may observe the pending transactions pool and insert their transaction before others.

4. The contract might be subject to a Denial of Service attack. For example, in the batchTransfer function, if one of the receiver addresses is a contract that throws an error, then that would stop the execution of the rest of the transfers.

5. The approve function in the StandardToken contract can potentially lead to a race condition, if called twice in a short time frame (known as a TOCTO vulnerability). This is also mentioned in the comment above the function. A possible solution to mitigate this race condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the desired value afterwards.

6. The contract doesn't seem to be affected by bad randomness, time manipulation or short address attacks based on the provided source code.

Please note that this is a preliminary assessment and further more detailed analysis may be required to ensure the safety and security of the smart contract.
