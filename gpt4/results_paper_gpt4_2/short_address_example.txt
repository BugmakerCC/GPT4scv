The provided code has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Arithmetic Issues: The `sendCoin` function contains potential integer overflow and underflow issues. When the `balances[msg.sender] -= amount` or `balances[to] += amount` operations are performed, they don't check if the result is under or overflowed. A mitigation could be to include checks to ensure that the sender's balance doesn't go below zero and the recipient's balance doesn't exceed its maximum limit.

2. Access Control: There are no access controls in place to restrict who can call the `sendCoin` function. This could allow an attacker to call this function and manipulate the balances of other addresses.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not check for the return value of the `Transfer` event. If the event fails to execute, the contract won't know and the state could be inconsistent.

4. Denial of Service: In a scenario where the `sendCoin` function is called with a large `amount`, it could potentially lead to a denial of service if the gas limit is reached before the function is able to complete.

5. Short Address Attack: The contract does not check length of the address provided to the `sendCoin` function. An attacker could potentially supply a short address, causing the remaining bytes to be interpreted as the `amount`, leading to a much larger amount of tokens being transferred than intended.

6. Bad Randomness / Front-Running / Time Manipulation: These vulnerabilities are not applicable to this contract as it doesn't involve any randomness, transaction ordering or timestamp dependence.

7. Reentrancy: This contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks as it doesn't make any external calls while the state is being modified.

In conclusion, while the contract has some vulnerabilities, it also has some areas where it's safe from common attack vectors. However, it should be updated to address the identified issues.
