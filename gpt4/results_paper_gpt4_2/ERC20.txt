The given smart contract is a basic implementation of an ERC20 token contract. It uses the SafeMath library to prevent Arithmetic Issues like Integer Overflow and Underflow. 

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not seem to have reentrancy vulnerabilities as there are no external contract calls.

2. Access Control: The contract does not have any specific access control checks. However, this is normal for an ERC20 token, as all functions are supposed to be public.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract uses the SafeMath library, which should prevent any arithmetic issues like Integer Overflow and Underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values: Not relevant in this case, as there are no low level calls.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not seem to have any functions that could potentially block the entire contract.

6. Bad Randomness: Not relevant as there is no randomness involved in the contract.

7. Front-Running: This is a potential issue in all Ethereum contracts, including this one. Attackers could potentially observe a pending transaction and then issue their own with a higher gas price, causing miners to prioritize it.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps or block numbers, so there should be no risk of time manipulation attacks.

9. Short Address Attack: This is mostly a client-side issue, and the contract cannot prevent it.

In summary, the contract seems to be well-written and does not appear to have any of the listed vulnerabilities, although front-running is a potential issue. However, it is always recommended to conduct a thorough audit before deploying a contract in a production environment.
