The smart contract provided has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: This contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it calls an external contract (msg.sender.transfer) without first altering the state (pastBlockTime).

2. Access Control: The contract lacks any form of access control, meaning that anyone can interact with it. In this case, it might be intentional as it's a gambling contract. However, without proper access control, it can be misused.

3. Bad Randomness: The contract uses "now" (alias for block.timestamp) for randomness. This is predictable and can be manipulated by miners, making it a bad source of randomness.

4. Denial of Service: Since the contract sends all its balance to the winner, if the contract's balance is depleted or if the gas price is too high, it may not be able to send the funds, causing a denial of service.

5. Time manipulation: The contract is dependent on "now" which can be manipulated by miners to some extent.

6. Arithmetic Issues, Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls, Front-Running, and Short Address Attack: These vulnerabilities are not present in this contract.

In conclusion, the smart contract is vulnerable to reentrancy, bad randomness, denial of service, and time manipulation. The contract should be revised to address these issues.
