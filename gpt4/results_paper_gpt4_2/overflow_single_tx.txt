The given smart contract has an Arithmetic Issues vulnerability specifically an Integer Overflow/Underflow vulnerability. This occurs when the values of 'count' variable in the contract is added, multiplied, or subtracted with an input value that is greater than what the 'count' variable can store.

1. In the first function 'overflowaddtostate', if the input is too large, 'count' can overflow and wrap to a very small number.

2. Similarly, in the 'overflowmultostate' function, if the input is too large, 'count' can overflow and wrap to a small number.

3. In the 'underflowtostate' function, if the input is larger than 'count', it can underflow and wrap to a very large number.

The same issue is there in 'overflowlocalonly', 'overflowmulocalonly', and 'underflowlocalonly' functions.

To fix this issue, checks should be put in place before performing the arithmetic operations to ensure that overflow or underflow conditions cannot occur. Safe math libraries like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library can be used to prevent such vulnerabilities.

The contract does not seem to have any of the other vulnerabilities named. There's no reentrancy as there are no external calls. The contract does not deal with randomness, so 'Bad Randomness' does not apply. There are no payable functions or ether transfers, so Denial of Service through block gas limit or through failing send does not apply. The contract does not have any conditions based on time, so Time manipulation does not apply. There's no access control in the contract, so it can't be breached. The contract doesn't seem to have any external interactions that could be frontrun. And finally, the contract is not dependent on the length of the address calling it, so the Short Address Attack does not apply.
