The given smart contract "SimpleSuicide" is vulnerable to the following vulnerability:

1. Access Control: The function "sudicideAnyone()" is not protected by any access control mechanism. This means that anyone can call this function and kill the contract. Ideally, such a function should only be accessible by the contract owner or a specific authorized entity. This can be done by implementing a modifier that checks the msg.sender against a stored contract owner address and only allows the function to be executed if they match. 

The contract does not seem to have the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: There are no external calls in the contract, hence there is no reentrancy vulnerability.
2. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations, hence there are no underflows or overflows.
3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not make any low-level calls.
4. Denial of Service: The contract does not contain any loops or high gas consumption operations, hence a DoS attack is unlikely.
5. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any random numbers, hence it is not vulnerable to attacks on randomness.
6. Front-Running: There is no state change based on external information, so front-running is not an issue.
7. Time manipulation: The contract does not rely on timestamps or block information, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.
8. Short Address Attack: The contract does not handle raw addresses, so it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.
