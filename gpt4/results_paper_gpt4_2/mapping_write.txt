This contract has several potential vulnerabilities:

1. Access Control: The contract has an "owner" variable but it does not have a constructor function to initially set the owner. This means that the owner will default to the zero address, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000. Since only the owner is permitted to withdraw funds from the contract, this function is essentially useless because the zero address cannot initiate transactions.

2. Arithmetic Issues: The `set` function increases the `map` array length by setting `map.length = key + 1;` if the provided key is greater than the current length. This could result in an integer overflow if a very large key is provided.

3. Unchecked Low Level Calls: The `withdraw` function uses `msg.sender.transfer` without checking the return value. While `transfer` does throw on failure, using `call.value()` instead would be safer as it allows handling failed sends.

4. Denial of Service: If the contract's balance is very large, the `withdraw` function could potentially fail due to gas limits. 

5. Time Manipulation: This contract does not use timestamps so it is not vulnerable to this type of attack.

6. Front-Running: This contract is not vulnerable to front-running because it does not involve any transaction ordering dependence.

7. Bad Randomness: This contract doesn't involve any randomness so it isn't vulnerable to this type of attack.

8. Short Address Attack: This contract does not deal with raw addresses so it is not vulnerable to this type of attack.

9. Reentrancy: This contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks as there are no external contract calls made before the contract state is modified.
