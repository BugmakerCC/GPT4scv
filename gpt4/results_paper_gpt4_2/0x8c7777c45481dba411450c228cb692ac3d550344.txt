The given smart contract has a critical vulnerability: Reentrancy. This vulnerability occurs in the `CashOut` function. 

In this function, the contract calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` before it reduces the balance of `msg.sender` with `_am` in `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`. An attacker can create a contract which calls `CashOut` in its fallback function. If the attacker then calls `CashOut` with an `_am` equal to the balance of the attacker, the contract will call the fallback function of the attacker's contract. This fallback function can then again call `CashOut`, and the contract will again send the `_am` to the attacker's contract. This can be repeated until the contract's balance is empty. This attack is known as a reentrancy attack.

To fix the vulnerability, the contract should first update the state (reduce the balance), and then transfer the funds. 

The contract does not seem to have other vulnerabilities from the list you provided. However, it's worth noting that the contract's logic allows only transactions larger than `MinDeposit` to be recorded in `balances` and `TransferLog`, but still accepts smaller deposits. This could lead to confusion or disputes. It's also worth noting that the contract does not have a mechanism for changing `MinDeposit` or the `TransferLog` address, which could lead to issues if the contract is used long-term.
