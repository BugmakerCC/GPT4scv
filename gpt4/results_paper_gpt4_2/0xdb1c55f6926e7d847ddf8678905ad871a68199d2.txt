This smart contract seems to exhibit a number of vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to Reentrancy in the `GetFreebie` and `withdraw` functions. This is because the state (balance) is updated after the call to `transfer`. An attacker can recursively call the `GetFreebie` and `withdraw` function before the state is updated and drain the contract's Ether.

2. Access Control: The contract is also vulnerable to Access Control issues. The contract owner can be changed in the `withdraw` function by whoever calls the function with the hardcoded address, which can lead to unauthorized access. There is also no check for the owner in the `GetFreebie` function which allows anyone to potentially drain the contract balance.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract is safe from this vulnerability as no arithmetic operations are performed.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: In the `Command` function, a low-level call is made without checking its return value. If the call fails for any reason, the contract will not be aware of it and may lead to unexpected behaviour.

5. Denial of Service: The contract could potentially be a victim of Gas limit DoS if the `Owner.transfer(this.balance)` operation in the `GetFreebie` function or `withdraw` function fails due to gas limits.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract is safe from this vulnerability as it doesn't rely on randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract is safe from this vulnerability as there is no dependency on transaction ordering.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract is safe from this vulnerability as there is no dependency on timestamps or block numbers.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract is safe from this vulnerability as it does not call external contracts with user-supplied address lengths.

Please note that this is a preliminary analysis and actual security may vary.
