The contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the `GetFreebie()` and `withdraw()` functions. The contract's state (`this.balance`) is not updated before the call to `msg.sender.transfer()`. An attacker could use this to drain the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: In the `withdraw()` function, the owner of the contract is changed without any checks or validations. This could allow an attacker to take over the contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: Although no arithmetic operations are performed directly in this contract, it relies on the value of `msg.value` and `this.balance` for its logic. If manipulated, this could lead to integer overflow or underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `Command()` function uses a low-level call without checking the return value. If the call fails, the contract will not be aware and will continue execution.

5. Denial of Service: The `withdraw()` function could potentially make the contract unusable if the owner's address is set to an address that throws an exception in its fallback function. 

6. Bad Randomness: Not directly applicable to this contract.

7. Front-Running: Not directly applicable to this contract.

8. Time Manipulation: Not directly applicable to this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: Not directly applicable to this contract. The contract doesn't take any address input from users that could be manipulated. 

It is recommended to mitigate these vulnerabilities by updating the contract's state before making any transfers, adding access control mechanisms, checking return values of low-level calls, and protecting against potential DoS attacks.
