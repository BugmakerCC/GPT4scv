This contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: In the `redeem` function, there is a reentrancy vulnerability where the contract sends all its balance to the `msg.sender` and the Owner. If the `msg.sender` is a contract, it could in its fallback function call `redeem` again before the first call to `redeem` has finished.

2. Access Control: The `withdraw` and `Command` functions are only protected by a simple `require` statement checking if the `msg.sender` is the Owner. If the Owner address is compromised, an attacker could withdraw all funds or execute arbitrary calls.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in this contract, so it is not vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: In the `Command` function, the return value of the low level `call` method is not checked. If the call fails, no exception is thrown and execution continues.

5. Denial of Service: The `redeem` function could potentially be abused to drain the contract of all its funds, resulting in a denial of service for other users. 

6. Bad Randomness: This contract does not involve any randomness, so it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: This contract does not deal with transaction ordering, so it is not vulnerable to front-running.

8. Time Manipulation: This contract does not rely on timestamps or block numbers, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract does not take any external input for addresses, so it is not vulnerable to short address attacks.
