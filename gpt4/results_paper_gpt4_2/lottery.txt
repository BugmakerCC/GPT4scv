The given smart contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Bad Randomness: The contract is using block.number % 2 to determine the winner. This is a bad source of randomness as it can be manipulated.

2. Front-Running: Since the contract's makeBet function is based on the current block number, miners or attackers can manipulate the transaction order to their advantage.

3. Time Manipulation: Similar to Front-Running, the contract is vulnerable to time manipulation attacks. An attacker or miner can manipulate the timestamp of the block to influence the outcome of the block.number % 2 operation.

4. Access Control: The contract has functions that can only be called by the organizer. However, the address of the organizer is not set in the constructor. This means that any address can become the organizer if they interact with the contract before the intended organizer.

5. Denial of Service: In the makeBet function, if the send function fails, it throws an exception which will consume all gas and can cause DoS.

6. Arithmetic Issues: Although not explicitly present in this contract, contracts like this often have arithmetic issues, especially when dealing with payments.

7. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not check the return value of the send function which can fail silently. If the send function fails, the contract will still consider the bet to have been won.

8. The contract does not have Reentrancy and Short Address Attack vulnerabilities.

9. There is no fallback function to prevent accidental Ether transfers to the contract. The fallback function in this contract uses the throw keyword which has been deprecated in newer versions of Solidity. It should be replaced with require or revert functions for error handling.

10. The contract uses the suicide function which can be a risk if not handled correctly because it permanently destroys the contract. In this case, only the organizer can call it, but as already mentioned, the organizer is not securely initialized.
