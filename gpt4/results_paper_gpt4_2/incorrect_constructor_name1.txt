The smart contract provided has a couple of vulnerabilities:

1) Access Control:
The function "IamMissing" is supposed to be the constructor of the contract due to the logic it contains (setting the owner of the contract), but it is not declared as a constructor. As a result, any user can call the "IamMissing" function and set themselves as the owner after the contract has been deployed. This is a severe access control issue.

2) Denial of Service: 
The "withdraw" function could lead to a denial of service attack. If the 'owner' address is a contract which fails during the execution of its fallback function, the 'withdraw' function will get stuck as it waits for the 'transfer' function to complete successfully.

3) Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls:
The contract uses 'transfer' which can lead to unchecked return values. If the call fails due to an exception (for example, if the recipient runs out of gas), the function will not return false, but rather revert the whole transaction. This might not be the intended behavior.

4) Reentrancy is not directly an issue here as there are no calls to external contracts before the state is settled, but could become a problem if the contract is extended and this is not taken into account.

5) The contract does not have any arithmetic operations, so there are no Arithmetic issues.

6) There are no uses of randomness, so Bad Randomness does not apply here.

7) Front-Running is not directly an issue here, but could be a potential problem in the 'withdraw' function if multiple users were able to call it.

8) The contract doesn't rely on timestamps or block data, so Time manipulation is not an issue.

9) The contract does not interact with external addresses, so Short Address Attack is not an issue.
