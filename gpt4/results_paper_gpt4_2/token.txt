The smart contract provided has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: No reentrancy vulnerability is present in this contract as there are no external function calls within a function.

2. Access Control: The contract does not seem to have any access control vulnerability. There are no restrictions on who can call the functions, but that is also not necessary in this particular case.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract has an underflow vulnerability in the `transfer` function. The require statement `require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);` will not prevent underflow because solidity allows unsigned integers to underflow. Instead, it should be `require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value);`.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: There are no low level calls in this contract.

5. Denial of Service: There is no Denial of Service vulnerability in this contract.

6. Bad Randomness: There's no randomness involved in this contract.

7. Front-Running: Front-Running could potentially be a concern because the order in which transactions are mined could affect the outcome of the `transfer` function.

8. Time manipulation: There is no dependency on timestamps or block numbers in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack because it does not take address input from the transaction sender directly.

These are potential vulnerabilities, and actual impact would depend on the usage context of the contract. Always consider additional security precautions such as using the latest version of Solidity, having a thorough test suite, and conducting a professional audit of the contract.
