This contract contains several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The CashOut function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The contract sends Ether with `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` before reducing the sender's balance. An attacker could create a fallback function in their contract that calls CashOut, causing them to withdraw more Ether than they should.

2. Access Control: The AddMessage function in the Log contract can be called by anyone, not just the ETH_FUND contract. This could allow an attacker to fill up the contract's storage, causing legitimate transactions to run out of gas.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not check for integer overflow or underflow. This is not an immediate vulnerability, but it should be addressed to prevent potential issues in the future.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses `call.value()()`, a low-level function, to send Ether. If this call fails, the contract will not be aware of the failure and continue execution as normal.

5. Denial of Service (DoS): The contract could be vulnerable to a DoS attack where an attacker repeatedly calls AddMessage in the Log contract, causing legitimate transactions to run out of gas.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable to this contract as it does not involve any randomness.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable to this contract as it does not involve any transaction ordering dependence.

8. Time manipulation: The contract uses the `now` keyword, which can be manipulated by miners to a certain degree. However, this does not seem to be a significant issue in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable to this contract as it does not read from `msg.data` length.
