The smart contract does not seem to have any of the mentioned vulnerabilities. 

1. **Reentrancy**: The contract does not make any external calls inside a function without first modifying its state, so it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
   
2. **Access Control**: The contract has appropriate checks for ensuring only the owner or animator can execute certain functions.

3. **Arithmetic Issues (Integer Overflow and Underflow)**: The contract uses the SafeMath library for all arithmetic operations which prevents integer overflow and underflow.

4. **Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls**: The contract does not use any low-level calls (like call.value() or call()) which could potentially fail silently.

5. **Denial of Service**: The contract does not have any loops that iterate over an unbounded number of elements, so it is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks due to high gas costs. 

6. **Bad Randomness**: The contract does not use any cryptographic functions that require randomness, so it is not vulnerable to attacks related to predictable random numbers.

7. **Front-Running**: The contract does not have any functions where the order of transactions could affect the outcome, so it is not vulnerable to front-running attacks.

8. **Time Manipulation**: The contract uses block.number for timing events, which cannot be manipulated by miners to a significant degree, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.

9. **Short Address Attack**: The contract checks the size of the payload for each function call, which can prevent short address attacks.

However, this analysis does not guarantee that the contract is completely secure. It is recommended to perform a comprehensive security audit before deploying the contract on the mainnet.
