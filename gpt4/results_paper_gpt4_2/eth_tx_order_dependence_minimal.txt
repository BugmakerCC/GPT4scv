The smart contract appears to have at least two potential vulnerabilities:

1. Front-Running (Transaction Ordering Dependence):
In the `setReward` function, the contract owner can transfer the reward to his own address. However, this operation is not protected against front-running. In the Ethereum network, a malicious miner could observe the transaction and insert their own transaction before it. They could call the `setReward` function themselves, setting a new reward and claiming it before the original transaction has a chance to be processed. 

2. Reentrancy:
The `claimReward` function can potentially be exploited due to a reentrancy vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs when a contract's function calls an external contract (in this case with `msg.sender.transfer(reward)`) and then proceeds to change its state (in this case, `claimed = true;`). A malicious contract could potentially exploit this by making a recursive call back into the `claimReward` function before `claimed` is set to true, draining the contract of Ether.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities:

- For the front-running issue, consider implementing a commit-reveal scheme to ensure that transactions cannot be front-run.

- For the reentrancy issue, use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern: ensure that all conditions are checked and all internal state changes are made before calling external contracts. For this contract, move `claimed = true;` before `msg.sender.transfer(reward);`.
