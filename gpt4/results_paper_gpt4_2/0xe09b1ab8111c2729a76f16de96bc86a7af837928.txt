After analyzing the smart contract, the following vulnerabilities and potential issues have been identified:

1. Reentrancy: This contract seems to be not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks as it doesn't make external calls to unknown addresses after changing its state.

2. Access Control: The contract implements the `onlyOwner` modifier which restricts access to certain functions to the owner of the contract only. However, there is a potential vulnerability if the contract owner becomes a malicious actor.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There doesn't seem to be any checks against integer overflow and underflow in this contract.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses `.transfer()` and `.send()` to send Ether without checking the return value of these calls. This can potentially lead to silent failing sends.

5. Denial of Service: This contract seems to be not vulnerable to DoS attacks as it doesn't have any loops that could be exploited.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract uses blockhash for generating a pseudo-random number. However, the blockhash might be influenced by miners to some extent.

7. Front-Running: This contract might be vulnerable to front-running attacks as transactions are public on the blockchain before they get mined.

8. Time manipulation: This contract uses the `block.number` for checking bet expiration which can potentially be manipulated by miners.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to short address attacks as it doesn't interact with user-provided addresses in a way that could be exploited. 

It's worth noting that the presence of these potential vulnerabilities does not necessarily mean the contract is exploitable. However, they indicate areas of the contract that may need further attention and possibly, improvement.
