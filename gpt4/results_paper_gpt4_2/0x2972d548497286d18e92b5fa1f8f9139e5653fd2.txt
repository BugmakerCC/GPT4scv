The given smart contract exhibits the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract has a potential Reentrancy vulnerability. The contract directly calls an external contract (caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v[i]);) within a loop. An attacker can potentially make a recursive call back to the 'transfer' function before the first invocation of the function has finished, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract uses a low level .call() function but does not check its return value. If the call fails, the contract will not be aware of it.

3. Access Control: There are no access control mechanisms in place. The 'transfer' function can be called by any account, not just the owner of the contract.

4. Denial of Service (DoS): If an attacker is able to cause the 'caddress.call()' to always fail (for example, by causing the called contract to run out of gas), then the loop will never finish, effectively locking up the contract.

To fix these issues, the contract should implement a check on the return value of the 'call' function to ensure it was successful, use a pull payment system to avoid potential reentrancy attacks, and implement access controls to restrict who can call sensitive functions in the contract. The DoS attack can be prevented by implementing a limit on the number of iterations the loop can perform, or by not calling external contracts within a loop.
