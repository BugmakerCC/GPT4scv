The smart contract provided has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function GetFreebie() is vulnerable to reentrancy. After the condition if(msg.value>1 ether), the contract transfers the balance of the contract to the owner, and then transfers the balance again to the msg.sender. If the owner is a malicious contract, it can call GetFreebie() again before the first execution ends, hence draining the contract's Ether.

2. Access Control: The contract does not check if the msg.sender is the owner before executing GetFreebie() function. This could mean anyone can call this function and possibly drain the contract if the condition if(msg.value>1 ether) is met. Moreover, the function Command() allows the owner to execute any function on any other contract. If the owner is malicious, it can exploit other contracts.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There doesn't seem to be any arithmetic operations in the contract. So, it may not be exposed to arithmetic issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The function Command() makes a low-level call without checking its return value, which can potentially cause the contract to fail silently.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not appear to have a direct denial of service vulnerability.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any randomness, so it may not be exposed to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not appear to have a direct front-running vulnerability.

8. Time manipulation: The contract does not use timestamps or block information, so it may not be exposed to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not appear to have a direct short address attack vulnerability.
