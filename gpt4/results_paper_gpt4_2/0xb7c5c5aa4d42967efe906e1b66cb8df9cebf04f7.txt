The smart contract you've provided is vulnerable to the Reentrancy attack.

The function `withdraw()` is vulnerable because it first calls `msg.sender.call.value(balances[msg.sender])()`, which sends ether to msg.sender, and then it sets the sender's balance to 0. If the sender is a malicious contract, it can call `withdraw()` again before `balances[msg.sender] = 0` is executed. This is known as a reentrant call. The malicious contract can keep draining the contract of its ether.

Here's how the contract can be fixed to eliminate the reentrancy vulnerability:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

contract keepMyEther {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    
    function () payable public {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
    
    function withdraw() public {
        uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.call.value(amount)();
    }
}
```

In this fixed version of the contract, the balance of msg.sender is set to 0 before the ether is sent. This ensures that, even if a reentrant call occurs, the balance for msg.sender is already 0, so no ether can be drained.

The original contract doesn't seem to have any of the other vulnerabilities you listed. However, please note that using `msg.sender.call.value()` is generally not recommended, because it can lead to unexpected behavior if the recipient is a contract. A better approach is to use `msg.sender.transfer()`, which also throws on failure, preventing any state changes.
