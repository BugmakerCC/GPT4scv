The smart contract code shows several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `GetFreebie` and `withdraw` functions contain a reentrancy vulnerability. After the contract's balance is sent to the owner in `Owner.transfer(this.balance)`, an attacker could recursively call `GetFreebie` or `withdraw` to drain the contract's balance.

2. Access Control: The `withdraw` function allows the owner to be changed to a hardcoded address `0x7a617c2B05d2A74Ff9bABC9d81E5225C1e01004b`. This could potentially grant an attacker control of the contract.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract doesn't seem to suffer from integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `Command` function uses a low-level `.call()` method without checking its return value. If this call fails, the contract will not be aware.

5. Denial of Service: The contract doesn't have a specific DOS vulnerability. However, if an attacker can repeatedly trigger the reentrancy vulnerability, they could potentially cause a DOS condition.

6. Bad Randomness: This contract doesn't rely on random number generation, so this vulnerability is not present.

7. Front-Running: Front-running could potentially be an issue when calling the `GetFreebie` function. The first transaction to be mined that calls `GetFreebie` with `msg.value > 1 ether` could retrieve all the contract's balance.

8. Time Manipulation: This contract doesn't rely on block timestamps, so this vulnerability doesn't apply.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract doesn't suffer from short address attacks as all address-related operations are adequately protected.

In conclusion, the main vulnerabilities in this contract are reentrancy, unchecked return values for low level calls, access control, and potential front-running. The contract should be updated to fix these issues.
