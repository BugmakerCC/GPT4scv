The smart contract provided has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The Collect function in the DEP_BANK contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. This is because the contract sends out Ether with `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` before it reduces the balance of the sender with `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`. An attacker can re-enter the function before the sender's balance is updated and withdraw more Ether than they should be able to.

2. Access Control: The contract doesn't seem to have access control measures in place. This means that anyone could potentially call any function including SetMinSum, SetLogFile, and Initialized. Not having proper access control in place exposes the contract to unauthorized changes and could potentially lead to other vulnerabilities.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not use SafeMath or similar libraries for performing arithmetic operations. This means that it is possible for an integer overflow or underflow to occur. The += and -= operations in the Deposit and Collect functions are particularly vulnerable.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract does not check the return value of the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` call. This is a low-level call and if it fails, it will not throw an exception, but will only return false. The contract should check the return value of the call and handle possible failures.

5. Denial of Service: The Deposit function could potentially cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if the contract runs out of gas during the execution of the deposit function. Also, as the contract relies on the `throw` keyword for error handling, which has been deprecated in favor of `revert()`, `require()` and `assert()`. If an exception is thrown, all gas is consumed, which could lead to a DoS condition.

6. Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, and Short Address Attack vulnerabilities do not seem to be present in the given contract. However, without a complete understanding of the business logic and use cases, it would be hard to assert this conclusively.

Please note that these are potential vulnerabilities and whether or not they can be exploited depends on various factors such as the solidity version being used, the Ethereum client being used, and the specific use cases of the contract.
