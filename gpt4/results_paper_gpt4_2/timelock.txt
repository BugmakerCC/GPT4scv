The contract doesn't seem to have all the vulnerabilities listed, but some potential issues could be:

1. Reentrancy: Although the contract doesn't directly call an unknown contract, the `withdraw` function sends Ether to `msg.sender` which could be a malicious contract. However, the contract is not vulnerable to a reentrancy attack since it correctly updates the balance of `msg.sender` to 0 before transferring the funds.

2. Access Control: The contract doesn't have any explicit access control mechanisms, so any address can interact with it and potentially manipulate the `lockTime` variable.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract is vulnerable to integer overflow in the `increaseLockTime` function. If `_secondsToIncrease` is a large enough value, it could cause the `lockTime[msg.sender]` to wrap around to a small value, allowing the user to withdraw their funds earlier than intended.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract doesn't check the return value of the `msg.sender.transfer` call, which could fail due to a gas stipend of 2300 gas not being enough.

5. Denial of Service: The contract doesn't seem to have a risk of being locked up by a user reaching the gas limit, throwing an exception, or breaching access control.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract doesn't rely on randomness.

7. Front-Running: The contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to front-running or transaction ordering dependence as it doesn't rely on transaction order or external calls to unknown contracts.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract relies on the `now` keyword, which can be manipulated by miners to a certain extent. This could potentially allow a miner to withdraw funds earlier than intended.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack as it doesn't take address inputs from users. 

In conclusion, this contract is potentially vulnerable to integer overflow in `increaseLockTime` and time manipulation by miners. It also doesn't check the return value of `msg.sender.transfer` which could lead to silent failures.
