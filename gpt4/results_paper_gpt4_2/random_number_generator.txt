This contract presents several vulnerabilities:

1. Bad Randomness: This contract uses block properties (block.timestamp, block.number, blockhash) as a source of randomness, which can be manipulated by miners. The pseudo-random number generated by this contract is predictable and not truly random, making it vulnerable to attack.

2. Time Manipulation (Timestamp Dependence): The contract uses block.timestamp (alias "now") as a source of randomness. This is a security risk as the timestamp can be manipulated by miners to a certain degree.

3. Arithmetic Issues: Potential for an integer underflow exists when calculating "x" and "y" if "max" or "salt" are somehow 0. There are no checks in place to prevent these kinds of calculations.

4. Access Control: The function "random" is marked as private, which means it can only be called from within the same contract. However, there isn't any other function in the contract that calls it, meaning it can't be used. While this isn't a vulnerability per se, it does make the contract ineffective.

To fix the vulnerabilities:

1. Use an oracle to generate random numbers. This would be more secure than relying on block properties.

2. Remove reliance on block.timestamp for randomness to avoid potential manipulation.

3. Implement checks to prevent division by zero which could cause arithmetic issues.

4. Add a public function that calls the "random" function, or make the "random" function public so that it can be used.
