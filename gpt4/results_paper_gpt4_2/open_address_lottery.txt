The contract seems to have the following vulnerabilities:

1. Bad Randomness: The function `luckyNumberOfAddress()` uses the `secretSeed` to generate a random number. The `secretSeed` is public and can be seen by miners. This can allow a miner to predict the next number and win the lottery.

2. Front-Running: If a user (or miner) can predict the lucky number, they can send a transaction when they know they are going to win. This is possible because the randomness is not safe, as mentioned above.

3. Access Control: The contract has a `kill` function and a `forceReseed` function that are only supposed to be called by the owner. However, there is no check to make sure the caller is the owner before selfdestructing the contract or reseeding. This can allow any user to call these functions.

4. Denial of Service: The contract will send all its balance to the winner if it can’t send the jackpot. This can make the contract useless if it doesn’t have enough balance.

5. Arithmetic Issues: The contract multiples the user's bet by 7 to calculate the win. If the bet is large enough, this multiplication can overflow, resulting in a smaller win than expected.

6. Unchecked Return Values for Low Level Calls: In the `participate` function, the contract sends money with the `transfer` function without checking its return value. If the call fails, the contract will continue its execution as if nothing happened.

7. Reentrancy: Although it's not directly visible, the contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.  The function `participate` calls `msg.sender.transfer(win)` before setting `winner[msg.sender] = true`. This allows the caller to enter `participate` again before `winner[msg.sender] = true` has been set.

For the rest, I can't see any indication of Time Manipulation, Short Address Attack, or any other vulnerabilities. However, without knowing the full context and interactions with other contracts or users, it's hard to be certain.
