This contract seems to have the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The 'GetFreebie' and 'withdraw' functions are transferring ether to external addresses which could make a fallback function call. If the fallback function calls 'GetFreebie' or 'withdraw' again, it could drain the contract's ether.

2. Access Control: Although the contract has an owner, the contract does not have a constructor function to permanently set the owner. The owner can be changed with the 'withdraw' function if the caller is the address '0x7a617c2B05d2A74Ff9bABC9d81E5225C1e01004b', which is hard-coded in the contract.

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The 'Command' function is making a low-level call without checking the return value.

4. Denial of Service: The 'GetFreebie' function transfers all the balance of the contract to the caller if the caller sends more than 1 ether. An attacker can send more than 1 ether and make the contract balance zero, causing a Denial of Service for other users.

5. Bad Randomness: This contract does not seem to be using any randomness.

6. Front-Running: As transactions are public on the blockchain, an attacker could see a transaction calling 'GetFreebie' or 'withdraw' function and create another transaction with a higher gas price to front-run the original transaction.

7. Time manipulation: This contract does not seem to have any time-dependent functionality, so no time manipulation issues are apparent.

8. Short Address Attack: This contract does not seem to be vulnerable to this attack since it does not manipulate the length of addresses.

In general, this code is lacking in secure coding practices. Without comments, it's unclear what the intended behavior is, which makes it easier for bugs and vulnerabilities to be introduced.
