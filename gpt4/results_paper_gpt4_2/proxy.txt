This smart contract has a potential reentrancy vulnerability in the `forward` function where it calls `callee.delegatecall(_data)`. 

Delegatecall is a low level function in Solidity that can change the state of the calling contract (Proxy), if the callee is a malicious contract. This is particularly dangerous because the callee contract could potentially be designed to recursively call the `forward` function, causing a reentrancy attack.

It is recommended to avoid using delegatecall to untrusted contracts. If the use of delegatecall is unavoidable, it is necessary to implement a reentrancy guard to prevent recursive calls.

Moreover, there is also an access control vulnerability in this contract. The `forward` function can be called by anyone because there is no access control implemented. This can potentially allow an attacker to forward calls to any arbitrary contract. 

A possible fix is to add a modifier to restrict access to the `forward` function to only the owner of the contract:

```
modifier onlyOwner() {
  require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the contract owner can call this function");
  _;
}
```
Then apply this modifier to the `forward` function:

```
function forward(address callee, bytes _data) public onlyOwner {
  ...
}
```

This will ensure that only the contract owner can forward calls to other contracts.
