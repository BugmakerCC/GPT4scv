The primary vulnerability in this smart contract is the Reentrancy vulnerability. In the `withdrawAll()` function, an external contract is called before the state (credit[msg.sender]) is updated. This allows for a recursive call, where the external contract can call `withdrawAll()` again before the first call has finished. This can lead to the contract's funds being drained.

To fix this, the state should be updated before the external call is made. Here's the updated `withdrawAll()` function:

```
function withdrawAll() public {
    uint oCredit = credit[msg.sender];
    if (oCredit > 0) {
        credit[msg.sender] = 0; // Moved this line before the external call
        balance -= oCredit;

        bool callResult = msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)();
        require (callResult);
    }
}
```

Other vulnerabilities like Access Control, Arithmetic Issues, Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls, Denial of Service, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, and Short Address Attack do not appear to be present in this contract, but a comprehensive audit should be done to confirm.
