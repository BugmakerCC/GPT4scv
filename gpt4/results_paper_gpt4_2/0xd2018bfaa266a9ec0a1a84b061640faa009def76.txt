This contract has several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `Get` and `withdraw` functions are susceptible to a reentrancy attack because they call the `transfer` function before updating the state of the contract. An attacker could recursively call the `Get` or `withdraw` function before the balance is updated and drain the contract's funds.

2. Access Control: The `Command` function allows the owner of the contract to execute arbitrary calls with provided data and value to any address. This could be a potential security risk if the owner's address is compromised. 

3. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `call` function in the `Command` function does not check the return value. If the called contract throws an exception or runs out of gas, the current contract will not be aware of it, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

4. Denial of Service: In the `Get` function, if the `msg.sender` is a contract and its fallback function consumes a lot of gas, it may cause a denial of service because the transfer function may fail due to out of gas. 

5. Bad Randomness: Not applicable in this contract.

6. Front-Running: Not applicable in this contract.

7. Time manipulation: Not applicable in this contract.

8. Short Address Attack: Not applicable in this contract.

In addition, there's another issue in the `Get` function. It checks if `msg.value > 1 ether`, and if so, it tries to transfer the entire balance of the contract to `msg.sender` and `Owner`. However, this could lead to an issue if the balance of the contract is less than the required amount, and it will cause the transfer to fail, resulting in an exception being thrown.

To mitigate these issues, avoid using low-level calls unless necessary, always check the return value of `call` function, use the pull over push payment pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks, and ensure all state changes happen before external calls to prevent reentrancy attacks.
