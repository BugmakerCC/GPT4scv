The given contract has a Reentrancy vulnerability. The issue occurs in the `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` function where `withdrawReward` is called before `claimedBonus[recipient]` is set to true. This allows a malicious contract to repeatedly call `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` while the original `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` call is still running (i.e., before `claimedBonus[recipient]` is set to true). This is possible because the external contract call in `withdrawReward` (via `recipient.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("")`) can call back into `getFirstWithdrawalBonus`.

To mitigate the reentrancy vulnerability, the state change (`claimedBonus[recipient] = true;`) should be done before calling the `withdrawReward` function. Another way to secure it is by using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which recommends to perform interactions with other contracts (which can include transfers of Ether) only as the very last step in any function.

Also, it's worth noting that using `call.value()` is a bad practice because it's a low-level function and it doesn't throw an exception when the call fails. It's recommended to use `address.transfer()` or `address.send()` instead. 

Here is the contract without the reentrancy vulnerability:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract Reentrancy_bonus{

    mapping (address => uint) private userBalances;
    mapping (address => bool) private claimedBonus;
    mapping (address => uint) private rewardsForA;

    function withdrawReward(address recipient) public {
        require(rewardsForA[recipient] > 0);
        uint amountToWithdraw = rewardsForA[recipient];
        rewardsForA[recipient] = 0;
        (bool success, ) = recipient.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("");
        require(success);
    }

    function getFirstWithdrawalBonus(address recipient) public {
        require(!claimedBonus[recipient]); // Each recipient should only be able to claim the bonus once

        claimedBonus[recipient] = true;
        rewardsForA[recipient] += 100;
        withdrawReward(recipient); 
    }
}
``` 

It's also recommended to upgrade to a newer version of Solidity. The contract uses ^0.4.0, but the latest version as of now is 0.8.7.
