This smart contract seems to have several vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The `withdraw` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. When `msg.sender.transfer(amount)` is called, the external contract can call back into `withdraw` before `Deposits[msg.sender]` has been decreased.

2. Access Control: The `proxy` function in the `Proxy` contract can be called by anyone, which can lead to unauthorized calls to other contracts.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The `deposit` function does not check for overflows when adding `msg.value` to `Deposits[msg.sender]`.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `proxy` function does not check the return value of `target.call.value(msg.value)(data)`. If the call fails, the contract will not be notified.

5. Denial of Service: If an attacker repeatedly calls the `deposit` function with `msg.value` greater than 0.5 ether, the contract could run out of gas.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable in this contract.

7. Front-Running: Not directly applicable, but if there's another function in the contract that depends on the state altered by `deposit` or `withdraw` functions, it could be prone to front-running.

8. Time manipulation: Not applicable in this contract.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable in this contract.

The contract should be revised to address these issues. For instance, it should implement a mechanism to prevent reentrancy attacks, restrict access to the `proxy` function, check for overflows in `deposit`, and check the return value of `call` in `proxy`.
