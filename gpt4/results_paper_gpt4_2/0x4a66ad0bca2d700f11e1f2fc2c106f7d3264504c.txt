The provided smart contract has multiple vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks as it does not make external calls while it is in a state of owing Ether to another contract.

2. Access Control: The function 'transfer' can only be called by the hard-coded address 0x9797055B68C5DadDE6b3c7d5D80C9CFE2eecE6c9. There is an access control vulnerability if the owner of the address loses access to the private key or the key is compromised.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There is a potential for integer overflow or underflow in the multiplication operation v[i]*1000000000000000000. If v[i] is very large, the result could overflow.

4. Unchecked Return Values for Low-Level Calls: The return value of the low-level 'call' function is not checked, which could lead to silent failures. If the call fails for any reason, the contract will continue execution as if nothing happened.

5. Denial of Service: No potential DoS vulnerabilities observed in this contract.

6. Bad Randomness: There is no usage of randomness in the contract, therefore it is not vulnerable to bad randomness attacks.

7. Front-Running: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to front-running attacks.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not depend on timestamps, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to short address attacks, as it does not slice the input address.

Please note that while these vulnerabilities are not present, it does not mean the contract is entirely secure. Always perform thorough testing and consider other possible attack vectors.
