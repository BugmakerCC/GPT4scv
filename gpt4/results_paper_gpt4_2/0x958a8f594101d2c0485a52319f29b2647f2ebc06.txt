1. Reentrancy: In this smart contract, there's no reentrancy vulnerability detected, as there are no external calls followed by state changes.

2. Access Control: There is an access control vulnerability in the function `execute`. Despite having the `onlyOwner` modifier, the function can still make arbitrary calls with `_dst.call.value(_value)(_data);`, which could be dangerous.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract, so no arithmetic issues detected.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The low-level call in `execute` function does not check the return value, which is an instance of this vulnerability.

5. Denial of Service: The contract contains a potential DoS vulnerability in the `sendMessage` function. If the `owner` address is a contract that rejects ether, the `owner.transfer(this.balance);` could indefinitely lock the contract.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not seem to use any randomness hence no Bad randomness vulnerability detected. 

7. Front-Running: There is no evidence of a front-running vulnerability as the contract does not appear to use any transaction ordering or time-dependent calculations.

8. Time manipulation: There is no evidence of time manipulation vulnerability as the contract does not use block timestamps for critical operations.

9. Short Address Attack: No evidence of a short address attack vulnerability was found in the contract. 

Bear in mind that while no evidence of some vulnerabilities was found, it doesn't necessarily mean the contract is free from them. It would be best to conduct a thorough audit to be sure.
