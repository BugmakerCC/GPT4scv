The given smart contract has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract seems to be vulnerable to the reentrancy attack because it is calling an external contract (caddress.call) in a loop without any mechanism to prevent recursive calls. An attacker can create a malicious contract that, when called by the 'transfer' function, calls back into the 'transfer' function before the first invocation is finished.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The contract is using a low-level call (caddress.call) and not checking the return value. This could potentially swallow any exceptions that occur during the execution of the call.

3. Access Control: The 'transfer' function is marked as 'public' which means it can be called by anyone. If this function is supposed to be restricted to certain addresses, then this is a vulnerability.

4. Arithmetic Issues: While it doesn't seem to have overflow/underflow issues, the use of multiplication and exponentiation with user-supplied input (v * 10 ** _decimals) can potentially lead to large numbers that exceed the limits of 'uint'. However, solidity should throw an exception in the case of an overflow.

5. Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, Short Address Attack: There's no indication of these vulnerabilities in this contract as it does not make use of randomness, timestamps, transaction ordering or address lengths.

6. Denial of Service: This is not directly present in the contract. However, if the '_tos' array is too large, it might cause the 'transfer' function to exceed the block gas limit, effectively blocking the execution of this function. 

Please note that vulnerabilities can vary based on the context and usage of the contract. It's always recommended to have a thorough security audit by a professional before deploying any smart contract.
