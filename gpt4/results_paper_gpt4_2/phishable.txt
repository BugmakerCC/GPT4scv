Analyzing the smart contract for the mentioned vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The contract does not seem to have a re-entrancy vulnerability as it doesn't call an external contract while its state is still being modified. 

2. Access Control: An access control vulnerability is present here. The contract checks that `tx.origin == owner` but `tx.origin` can be manipulated by a malicious contract that calls this contract, thus allowing unauthorized access.

3. Arithmetic Issues: The contract does not seem to perform any arithmetic operations, so it doesn't seem to have integer overflow or underflow issues.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: This contract uses `.transfer()` which throws on failure, so this is not an issue here.

5. Denial of Service (DoS): If the owner becomes a contract that always throws when receiving Ether, it could lock the funds in this contract forever, representing a potential DoS vulnerability.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not seem to use any randomness, so this doesn't seem to be an issue here.

7. Front-Running: There does not appear to be a vulnerability to front-running, as no transaction ordering dependency is apparent in the contract.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract does not use timestamps, so it doesn't seem to have a timestamp dependency issue.

9. Short Address Attack: This vulnerability is typically more about the interaction between off-chain software and the on-chain contract. Since the contract does not have any function that takes an address and an amount as parameters, it is not vulnerable to a short address attack.
