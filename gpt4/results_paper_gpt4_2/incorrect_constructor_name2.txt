This smart contract appears to have a severe vulnerability related to Access Control. 

The contract is intended to set the `owner` address in the `missing` function, which appears to be designed as a constructor function. However, in Solidity version 0.4.22 and later, a constructor function should be declared using the `constructor` keyword rather than the contract name. Because the `missing` function is not a valid constructor, it can be called by any address, not just once at the time of contract creation. This means that any user can change the `owner` of the contract.

This is an instance of the SWC-118 "Incorrect Constructor Name" vulnerability. It's a critical issue because it allows any address to take ownership of the contract and withdraw all the funds.

To fix this issue, you should declare the constructor as follows:

```solidity
constructor() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
}
```

Additionally, there's a potential Denial of Service vulnerability. The `withdraw` function sends Ether to the `owner` address with the `transfer` function, which has a gas limit of 2300 gas. If the `owner` address is a contract that consumes more than 2300 gas in its fallback function, the `transfer` will fail and the `withdraw` function will be blocked. A safer way to send Ether is to use the `call.value()("")` function, which does not limit the gas sent with the Ether.

The `withdraw` function should be modified like this:

```solidity
function withdraw() public onlyowner {
    (bool success, ) = owner.call.value(address(this).balance)("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed.");
}
```

I didn't find the other mentioned vulnerabilities in this contract.
