There appear to be several potential vulnerabilities in this smart contract. 

1. Reentrancy: The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it first sends Ether with a call.value function and then decreases the balance. An attacker could create a fallback function in their contract that calls the `WithdrawToHolder` function again to withdraw more Ether than they should be able to.

2. Access Control: The `onlyOwner` modifier does not properly restrict access because it does not use the `require` keyword. As a result, any account can call functions that should be restricted to the contract owner.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are potential underflow issues in the `WithdrawToHolder` function. If the `_wei` value is greater than `Holders[_addr]` then the subtraction operation will underflow and the balance will be a very large number.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The low level `.call` function in `WithdrawToken` function does not check the return value. This can lead to silent fails.

5. Denial of Service: An attacker could use up all the gas in the `WithdrawToHolder` function by making the function call itself recursively in a fallback function. This could make the contract unable to process other transactions.

6. Bad Randomness: Not applicable. This contract does not involve randomness.

7. Front-Running: Not applicable. This contract does not involve transaction ordering.

8. Time manipulation: Not applicable. This contract does not depend on timestamps.

9. Short Address Attack: Not applicable. This contract does not handle raw addresses from external input.
