The SimpleWallet contract exhibits several of the vulnerabilities listed.

1. Reentrancy: This is one of the most critical vulnerabilities in smart contracts. It can occur when the contract's state is altered after an external call. In the `withdraw` function, the contract sends ether to an address before updating its state. If the receiving address is a contract, it could potentially call back into the `withdraw` function before the first invocation has completed, causing more ether to be sent than was intended.

2. Access Control: The contract seems to handle this correctly. It uses a modifier `onlyOwner` to restrict certain functions (`withdrawAll`, `withdraw`, `sendMoney`) to the owner only.

3. Arithmetic Issues: This contract doesn't have any clear arithmetic issues. However, it's important to remember that if it did, underflows and overflows could lead to unintended outcomes.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: The `sendMoney` function uses a low-level call, which can be risky. It doesn't check the return value of the `call` function, which means it won't throw an exception if the call fails.

5. Denial of Service: There's a potential for a DOS attack in the `withdrawAll` function. If the `withdraw` function fails, the contract will be stuck in a state where funds cannot be withdrawn.

6. Bad Randomness: This contract doesn't use any randomness, so this vulnerability doesn't apply.

7. Front-Running: This contract doesn't have any operations where transaction ordering would change the outcome, so it's not vulnerable to front-running.

8. Time manipulation: This contract doesn't depend on timestamps or block numbers, so it's not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: This contract doesn't take any token transfers or similar operations, so it's not vulnerable to a short address attack.

In general, it's recommended to avoid using low-level calls like `call.value()()` and use `transfer` or `send` instead, as they automatically throw an exception if the call fails. Also, always update your contract's state before making external calls to prevent reentrancy attacks.
