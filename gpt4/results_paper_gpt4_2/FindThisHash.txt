The smart contract provided has the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The function `solve` has a `msg.sender.transfer(1000 ether);` without any state changes before it, which can potentially lead to reentrancy attacks. However, there is no fallback function in the contract to allow for the attacker to make a recursive call back into the contract.

2. Access Control: There are no specified access controls in this contract, which means any address can call the `solve` function. However, since the function requires a correct input to execute, it might not be an issue in this case.

3. Arithmetic Issues: There are no arithmetic operations in the contract, hence no underflow or overflow can occur.

4. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls: There are no low-level calls (like call, callcode, delegatecall, send) in this contract.

5. Denial of Service: The contract does not have any patterns that could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

6. Bad Randomness: The contract does not use any random number generation, hence it is not vulnerable to bad randomness.

7. Front-Running: There is a potential for front-running here as the solution to the `hash` could potentially be seen in the transaction pool before it gets mined, allowing a miner to copy the solution and get the reward.

8. Time Manipulation: The contract doesn't use any timestamp or block number related functionalities, hence it is not vulnerable to time manipulation.

9. Short Address Attack: The contract does not seem to be vulnerable to short address attacks as it does not take an address as an input parameter.

Additional Vulnerability: The contract uses the `sha3` function which was deprecated in Solidity 0.5.0 and replaced by `keccak256`, which is considered to be more secure.
