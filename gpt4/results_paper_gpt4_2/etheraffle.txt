After analyzing the smart contract, we can identify a few potential vulnerabilities:

1. **Reentrancy** - The contract seems safe from reentrancy attacks. All the state changes are done before the external calls. The external calls are `msg.sender.transfer()` in `buyTickets()`, `chooseWinner()`, `getRefund()`, and `endRaffle()`. 

2. **Access Control** - Some functions like `endRaffle()`, `togglePause()`, and `kill()` could be vulnerable if the `feeAddress` is compromised, as it has the power to pause the contract, end the raffle, and even wipe out the contract. It is recommended to use a multisignature wallet or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for better access control.

3. **Arithmetic Issues** - The contract seems safe from integer overflow and underflow problems.

4. **Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls** - The contract doesn't use low-level calls. All the transfers are done using `transfer()`, which throws an exception if the call fails.

5. **Denial of Service (DoS)** - The contract could be vulnerable to DoS attacks in `buyTickets()`, `chooseWinner()`, `getRefund()`, and `endRaffle()`. If one of the participants is a contract that throws an exception in its fallback function, it could prevent the execution of these functions.

6. **Bad Randomness** - The contract uses `block.coinbase`, `msg.sender`, and `block.difficulty` to generate a pseudo-random number. But these values can be influenced by miners to some extent, which could lead to manipulation of the winning number.

7. **Front-Running** - The contract is vulnerable to front-running. Since the `buyTickets()` function is public, attackers can observe the transaction pool and try to buy the winning ticket before the original transaction gets mined.

8. **Time Manipulation** - The contract doesn't depend on timestamps, hence it is safe from time manipulation attacks.

9. **Short Address Attack** - The contract doesn't seem to be vulnerable to a short address attack as it doesn't take any address inputs from external calls.
