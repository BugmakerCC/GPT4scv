This smart contract has at least two vulnerabilities:

1. Access Control: 
The contract uses `tx.origin` for authorization, which is a security risk. If a contract that is called by another contract uses `tx.origin` for authorization, an attacker contract can trick the origin contract into sending a transaction that calls the target contract, thereby allowing the attacker to be authorized. It's better practice to use `msg.sender` for authorization.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls:
The `transfer` function in Solidity does not allow the recipient to do anything during execution because it only provides a stipend of 2300 gas (not enough to make any state changes). However, it's still a good practice to check the return value of `transfer`. If the recipient is a contract, and the contract's fallback function fails, `transfer` will propagate the exception, and this could be handled properly.

There's no explicit evidence of other vulnerabilities such as Reentrancy, Arithmetic Issues, Denial of Service, Bad Randomness, Front-Running, Time manipulation, Short Address Attack in this contract. However, without the entire context or the usage scenario of this contract, it's hard to rule them out completely. For example, if the `amount` parameter in `sendTo` function is controlled by user input or relies on block properties like block timestamp, it could potentially lead to Bad Randomness or Time Manipulation issues.
