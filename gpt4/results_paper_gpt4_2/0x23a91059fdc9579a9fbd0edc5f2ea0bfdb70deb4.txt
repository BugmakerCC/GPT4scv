The given smart contract appears to contain the following vulnerabilities:

1. Reentrancy: The 'CashOut' function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The contract first sends ether with `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` and after that, it updates the user's balance with `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`. An attacker can recursively call the 'CashOut' function before `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` is executed, which would allow the attacker to drain the contract's funds.

2. Unchecked Return Values For Low-Level Calls: The return value of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the 'CashOut' function is not checked. If the call fails for any reason, the user's balance is not decreased.

3. Access Control: The 'AddMessage' function in the 'Log' contract can be called by any address, which could lead to incorrect log entries.

4. Denial of Service: If the address to which ether is being sent in the 'CashOut' function is a contract that has a fallback function which consumes a lot of gas or throws an exception, the 'CashOut' function could consistently fail, locking the funds of the user.

5. Arithmetic Issue: Although not present, this contract could benefit from SafeMath library which could prevent any future arithmetic underflow/overflow.

6. Front-running: Any user can see pending transactions and their details. This means a malicious actor could potentially intercept a transaction, and knowing the amount being withdrawn, they could adjust their own transactions to take advantage of this information.

The contract does not appear to contain vulnerabilities related to Bad Randomness, Time Manipulation, or Short Address Attacks. However, these vulnerabilities should be considered in further contract development.
